"Identifying User Experience Dimensions for Mobile Incident Reporting in Urban Contexts","M. Winckler; C. Bach; R. Bernhaupt","ICS-IRIT, Universit&#233; Paul Sabatier, Toulouse Cedex, France","IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication","","2013","56","2","97","119","Research problem: Despite the increasing interests raised by incident reporting systems, it is still unclear what dimensions of user experience (UX) and other contextual factors should be taken into account for the various stages of declaring an incident using mobile-phone applications. Research questions: How do citizens perceive and describe urban incidents? What UX dimensions are important for reporting an incident with a mobile-phone application? What other (contextual) factors are important from the users' point of view when declaring incidents? Which of the UX dimensions and contextual factors are important when in the various phases during an incident declaration? Literature review: Overall, there is a lack of empirical research in the domain of incident reporting. In general, the UX dimensions-visual and aesthetic experience, emotion, stimulation, identification, meaning and value, and social relatedness/coexperience-are important when designing interactive systems. It also shows that incidents are related to the citizen's perception of the environment. Methodology: A triangulated method approach combining interviews, a survey of existing systems, and a model-based task analysis were applied. This allows us to present a generic task model for incident reporting with a detailed description of UX dimensions affected in the various subtasks. Results and conclusions: Our findings point out the effect of UX dimensions in the task engaged by users when reporting urban citizens. The overall UX is directly influenced by the perceived level of severity, inconvenience and involvement, the personal context, and the technological mobile context. We have found that while several UX dimensions are highly relevant, they are not equally distributed along the several subtasks that citizens engage when reporting incidents. This study shows that semistructured requirement interviews can provide information about UX dimensions and it highlights the importance of the identifi- ation of UX dimensions in early phases of the development process.","0361-1434;03611434","","10.1109/TPC.2013.2257212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6524092","e-government;incident reporting;mobile services;service quality;smart phone;user experience (UX)","Electronic government;Smart phones","government data processing;interactive systems;mobile computing;smart phones;task analysis","UX dimensions;interactive systems;mobile incident reporting system;mobile-phone applications;model-based task analysis;semistructured requirement interviews;social relatedness-coexperience;triangulated method approach;user experience dimensions","","3","","50","","","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Threat evaluation is a catalogue based analysis, outlining various applicable protection levels related to architecture, hardware, software and personnel, aiming to standardize the information security management approach. Vulnerability analysis is attempting to evaluate organizational and technical aspects of all information security components in terms of their inherent flaws. Risk analysis combines both threat and vulnerability analysis in order to define countermeasures in an objective, measurable and sustainable way. However, very often all three possible approaches are devoid of economic and financial analysis of seaport information security investments. In this paper authors propose a combined model which includes both technical and financial approach to information security management and decision-making in Croatian Port Community Systems.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240883","","Decision making;Economics;Information security;Investments;Software","cataloguing;investment;organisational aspects;risk analysis;sea ports;security of data","Croatian Port Community Systems;Croatian seaports;catalogue based analysis;decision-making;economic analysis;financial analysis;information security components;information security management systems;investment analysis;organizational aspects;risk analysis;seaport information security investments;technical aspects;vulnerability analysis;vulnerability management","","0","","9","","","21-25 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SQD can detect a quench based on the change of absolute pressures (APs) and mass flow rates of helium in the cooling lines of the TF coils. If the primary quench detection system of the TF coils cannot detect a quench or the fast discharge of the TF coils cannot be carried out as planned, SQD should work to prevent the TF coils and the peripheral structures from severe damages. In addition, SQD should operate in the reliable and stable condition against the disturbances caused by the poloidal field coil discharge, plasma perturbation, and any faults of subsystems of the KSTAR device. The 2-out-of-3 (2oo3) voting configuration was applied to the SQD to enhance the reliability and stability of quench detection. The prototype SQD consists of AP and differential pressure transducers, signal interfaces, logic solvers, and interlock systems. All the transducers were selected from metallic types with no electronic circuit in order to reduce the failure rates caused by strong electromagnetic field and radiation around the tokamak. The transducers were installed in the manifolds of the helium inlet lines of the KSTAR TF coils. Their signals were amplified and compared with the reference voltage for quench decision in the signal interface unit. The quench signal generated by the signal interface unit was transmitted to the 2oo3 voting modules of the logic solvers. The design requirements of SQD were verified through testing the prototype SQD in the 2014 KSTAR campaign.","0093-3813;00933813","","10.1109/TPS.2016.2542863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448984","Component;pressure measurement;reliability;superconducting coils","Coils;Plasmas;Prototypes;Reliability;Superconducting magnets;Toroidal magnetic fields;Transducers","Tokamak devices;plasma electromagnetic wave propagation;plasma instability;plasma pressure;plasma toroidal confinement;pressure transducers;reliability","KSTAR TF coils;KSTAR device;Korea superconducting Tokamak advanced research;SQD;TF secondary quench detection system;absolute pressure change;differential pressure transducers;electromagnetic field;helium inlet lines;interlock systems;logic solvers;peripheral structures;plasma perturbation;poloidal field coil discharge;radiation around;signal interface unit;signal interfaces;toroidal field secondary quench detection system","","1","","","","20160407","Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We present a theoretical study showing that the increase of the ground-state sub-band energy induced by the quantum confinement associated with this scaling results in a dramatic reduction of the barrier at the channel/gate-insulator interface, which causes an increase of the leakage current across the gate insulator. We have studied the problem using scaling rules extracted from the 2011 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)-Roadmap (finding them excessively relaxed) and using more strict scaling rules from the literature confirmed by simulations of 5-nm gate-length III-V FETs. Employing local empirical pseudopotentials to calculate the electronic structure of Si and InAs thin bodies, the leakage gate current in the ON-state is shown to reach worrisome values at gate lengths of about 5 nm. This suggests that 1-D channels (i.e., NWs), but especially channels based on intrinsically 2-D (e.g., graphene/graphane or transition-metals dichalcogenides) or 1-D (e.g., carbon nanotubes) structures, are required to push scaling toward the 5-nm node.","0018-9383;00189383","","10.1109/TED.2013.2280844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606867","Gate leakage;quantum confinement;scaling","Field effect transistors;Hafnium compounds;Insulators;Leakage currents;Logic gates;Silicon;Tunneling","III-V semiconductors;elemental semiconductors;field effect transistors;indium compounds;leakage currents;nanowires;silicon","1D channels;ITRS-roadmap;InAs;International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors roadmap;NW channel;Si;channel-gate-insulator interface;electronic structure;field-effect transistors;gate leakage current;gate-length III-V FETs;ground-state subband energy;local empirical pseudopotentials;nanowire channel;quantum confinement;scaling field-effect transistors;semiconductor channels;size 5 nm","","12","","35","","20130923","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Generally, power system blackout can be mitigated by referring to the risk assessment of a power system. This paper presents the risk assessment of a power system performed by using the proposed bootstrap technique and the fuzzy set technique. The risk of the system is measured by using the expected energy not supplied (EENS) index as well as the probability of load curtailment (PLC) index.

Risks may arise from factors such as printer manufacturers not having the requisite levels of security awareness, and not fully understanding the need for security measures to protect intellectual property, and other sensitive data that are stored, accessed, and transmitted from such devices. This paper examines the security features of two different models of MakerBot Industries' consumer-oriented 3D printers and proposes an attack technique that is able to, not only, exfiltrate sensitive data, but also allow for remote manipulation of these devices. The attack steps are discretely modeled using a threat model to enable formal representation of the attack. Specifically, we found that the printers stored the previously printed and currently printing objects on an unauthenticated web server. We also ascertain that the transport layer security implementation on these devices was flawed, which severely affected the security of these devices and allowed for remote exploitation. Countermeasures to the attack that are implementable by both the manufacturer and the user of the printer are presented.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2578285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7487008","3D printing vulnerabilities;data exfiltration;remote attack;threat model","Internet of things;Printers;Security;Solid modeling","consumer electronics;file servers;industrial property;printers;production engineering computing;security of data","MakerBot industry consumer-oriented 3D printers;consumer 3D printers;data exfiltration;formal attack representation;industry sectors;intellectual property protection;printer manufacturers;remote device manipulation;remote exploitation attack;security awareness;transport layer security implementation;unauthenticated Web server","","","","32","","20160608","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a result, a reduction in the resistance of an insulator can be observed, and a portion of the insulator becomes electrically conductive. Such a process can be described as the change of conductivity of the dielectric, which in this case, is a nonlinear function of the electric field. In this paper, the nonlinear conductivity is incorporated into Maxwell's equations, and the resulting nonlinear equation is solved using the time-domain finite-element method together with Newton's method (NM). The Jacobian matrix required in the NM is analytically derived to obtain a numerical solution with good accuracy and efficiency.

However, the approach favours large industrial users and has been difficult to apply to smaller users due to the cost and complexity of standard metering solutions. With the introduction of smart metering for domestic and smaller demand sites and the significant interest for micro/embedded generation, an opportunity exists to develop a new form of energy purchase optimisation for smaller aggregated demand sites. Aggregation has been accomplished through a simple pooling arrangement or through the formation of demand clusters in the past with no reference to on-site generation capability (conventional or renewable). This paper provides a framework for the development of a number of new approaches that are under consideration to utilise the capability of smart metering for electricity and gas aggregated demand to: optimise energy source selection, decrease purchase costs and improve the environmental footprint.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125651","","Educational institutions;Monitoring;Power engineering;SCADA systems;Security;Smart grids","","","","0","","","","","5-8 Sept. 2011","","VDE","VDE Conference Publications"

Therefore, it is presenting a critical issue for knowledge mining, analysis and trending. For that reason, this work presents a knowledge acquisition and management platform based on the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is presenting the capability to connect any object to Internet. These Smart Objects are providing an enormous quantity of data. This work is focused on the personal and mobile health areas, where the integration of clinical devices in the patient's environment, this will enable new services with capabilities to predict health anomalies in real time, send alerts, reminders and offer an enriched feedback to the patient. This feedback will help and motivate to the patients with the treatments adherence and compliance and to follow a healthy lifestyle. In order to reach these services and feedback capabilities, it is required a full integration of the clinical devices and efficient processing of the collected data. The presented knowledge acquisition and management architecture is composed of, on the one hand, a gateway and a personal clinical device used for the integration of clinical devices, wireless transmission of continuous vital signs through 6LoWPAN, and patient identification through RFID.

The main goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of different available multi-core systems over single-core systems. In order to achieve this goal, two scheduling algorithms are implemented in order to schedule a Java language application by utilizing multithreading programming. The application is executed first in a single-core system and then in a multi-core system. In both systems has been measured the execution time which is a determinant parameter to compare the performance. The results show that the multi-core systems perform better but on the costs of complexity of the design and implementation.","","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968500","Multi-core;Multithreading;Performance;Scheduling algorithm Complexity;Terms-Single-core","Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Instruction sets;Java;Multicore processing;Scheduling algorithms","Java;computational complexity;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;performance evaluation;scheduling","Java language application;complexity cost;multicore systems;multithreading programming;scheduling algorithms;single-core systems","","0","","13","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The analysis is conducted using a discrete event simulation model of an airspace network with several airports, sectors and alternative airways. The results of the analysis indicate that when both Miles-in-Trails (MIT) restrictions for the airspace, as well as, TFM rerouting in collaboration with the AOC takes place, the performance of the overall system achieves a reduction of 67% in delay costs, 61% in delay time, 22% in delay rate and 69% in total passengers delay time (compared to the baseline).

Second, to evaluate the system performance, classification accuracy and gesture number to be recognized was compromised using information transfer rate (ITR). We found a system which can recognize 10 gestures could achieve similar ITR as the system which can recognize 20 gestures. However, the 10-gesture system was more robust. Third, K-L divergence was used to evaluate the separability of the EMG signals from different gestures.

People react differently to strategic initiatives, such as the introduction of EA, depending on their work level and how a new initiative such as EA may impact them. Through identification of work level related human factors known to impact on introduction and use of EA as strategy, organisations can ensure that the implementation and execution of EA succeed. The acceptance of technology and the socio-technical issues affecting the acceptance of new strategies in organisations have been researched for many years. Work level related human factors impacting EA acceptance have, however, not explicitly been described in past research. In this paper, research towards identifying the human factors that impact on the acceptance of EA as strategy is described.

Different energy savings methods can be used if data needed to measure the energy saving in an accurate manner are available (econometric models, bottom up, top down based on indicators, etc.). As an alternative to measuring energy consumption, efficiency progress in the different sectors can be monitored by using energy efficiency indicators (e.g. Odyssee [2]). In Lebanon Odysee's indicators are available since year 2000 [3] (developed by the Lebanese Association for Energy Saving and for Environment, ALMEE, in the frame of the Energy Efficiency indicators database initiated by the Mediterranean Association of the National Agencies for Energy Conservation, MEDENER). The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2011–2015 (NEEAP) for Lebanon was approved by the Council of Ministers on 10 November 2010 [4]. This paper presents an evaluation of the Lebanese NEEAP. It concludes that its targets were not satisfactory achieved (18.6 GWh/year of energy saving achieved from 2087.6 GWh/year targeted). The first Lebanese NEEAP was not designed as a strategic document according to the requirement of the Energy Saving Directive [5]. This paper presents in concise manner what should be included in a “good” NEEAP to help in the preparation of the second NEEAP (2016–2020). The paper argues that new NEEAP (2016–2020) should define energy saving target as maximum primary energy consumption (Mtoe) able to detailed assessment (by independent evaluator) of the energy savings through top down or bottom up calculation methods and ALMEE/MEDENER Odyssee's indicators.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1864-2; POD:978-1-5090-1865-9","10.1109/REDEC.2016.7577564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577564","Bottom-up;Electricity;Energy Saving;Evaluation;Lebanon;NEEAP;Top-Down","Electrostatic discharges;Energy conservation;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Energy measurement;Indexes;Market research","","","","","","","","","13-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With this architecture, we can obtain a self-starting voltage below the enhancement transistor's threshold due to its normally-on operation. The key advantages are the CMOS compatibility, inductor-less solution and no extra post-fabrication processing. The topology has been simulated in 0.18μm technology using a transistor-level model and has been compared to the traditional charge pump structure. The depletion-based voltage doubler charge pump enables operation from an input voltage as low as 250mV compared to 400mV in an enhancement-based one.

"Analysis of BDS ARAIM user receiver nominal bias","Sida Zhang; Zhipeng Wang; Yanbo Zhu; Wei Zhi","Beihang University, Beijing, China","2016 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance (ICNS)","","2016","","","3B2-1","3B2-11","Beidou navigation satellite system (BDS) has provided open services for the most part of the AsiaPacific region and plans to provide global service in 2020. In the future, it is necessary for BDS to support ARAIM. As an important parameter of ARAIM, the maximum nominal bias (B<sub>nom</sub>) of BDS need to be determined. This paper aims to estimate the impact of nominal biases on ARAIM user performance of BDS. In particular, we focus on the signal deformation and the satellite group delay of BDS signal. To estimate the nominal bias caused by the signal deformation, it is assumed that the code measurements are affected by the correlation loss. The ICAO has described the fault signal distortions of broadcast signal. But it is not appropriate to BDS. We chose a model modified by the comprehensive consideration of the filter provided by Stanford University and 2OS TMB configuration provided by Beijing Satellite Navigation Center. Ideally, the satellite antenna is supposed as a point source for the signals. But the real antenna has biases with the look angle. To estimate the nominal bias caused by the satellite group delay, we assume that BDS signal group delay is similar to GPS IIR-A. In order to guarantee the rationality of B<sub>nom</sub>, a simulation of maximum nominal bias for GPS+BDS has been operated in this paper.","","","10.1109/ICNSURV.2016.7486339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7486339","","Correlation;Delays;Distortion;Global Positioning System;Receivers;Satellite broadcasting;Satellites","Global Positioning System;radio receivers;satellite antennas","Asia-Pacific region;BDS ARAIM user receiver nominal bias analysis;BDS signal satellite group delay;Beidou navigation satellite system;Beijing satellite navigation center;GPS IIR-A;ICAO;broadcast signal;code measurement;correlation loss;fault signal distortion;satellite antenna;signal deformation","","","","17","","","19-21 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the inter-connecting wires are physically secured so that a malicious user cannot access them directly, then this simplifies the security management of the network. However, substituting the wired network with a wireless network - also referred to as an Avionics Wireless Network (AWN) - brings a set of new challenges related to assurance, reliability, and security; even for a specific set of well-defined and non-critical tasks. The AWN has to ensure that it provides at a minimum the existing required levels of safety offered by the equivalent wired network. These challenges are underpinned by a necessity to boot the AWN to a secure and trusted state, before it can be used to bridge different parts of the IMA in an aircraft. In this paper, we discuss the security and trust challenges an AWN boot process might face, along with highlighting a potential solution. Finally, the paper evaluates the proposed validation solution that meets the stated security requirements, based on the security challenges discussed.","","","10.1109/ICNSURV.2016.7486322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7486322","","Aerospace electronics;Computer architecture;Hardware;Proposals;Reliability;Security;Wireless networks","aircraft communication;avionics;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing","AWN boot process;IMA;aircraft;avionics wireless network;integrated modular avionics;interconnected avionics equipment;interconnecting wires;malicious user;network security management;security challenges;security requirements;trust challenges;trusted state;wired technology","","","","31","","","19-21 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The relationships between users, groups and activities are very complex and become a barrier to any group activities in having seamless communications. In this paper, we identify important features for single dimension and multi-dimensional communications in five domains of collaborative applications. Then, we analyze the important factors for designing mechanism to support the multi-dimensional communication based on user preference.

These benefits are more evident were the end-use loads are natively DC (e.g., computers, solid-state lighting or variable speed drives for electric motors), like in data centers and commercial buildings, but also in houses. When considering the presence of onsite renewable generation, e.g. PV or micro-wind generators, storage systems and electric vehicles, DC-based building microgrids can bring additional benefits, allowing direct coupling of DC loads and DC Distributed energy Resources (DERs). A number of demonstrating installations have been built and operated around the world, and an effort is being made both in USA and Europe to study different aspects involved in the implementation of a DC distribution system (e.g. safety, protection, control) and to develop standards for DC building application. This paper discusses on the planning of an experimental DC microgrid with power hardware in the loop features at the University of Naples Federico II, Dept. of Electr. Engineering and Inf. Technologies. The microgrid consists of a 3-wire DC bus, with positive, negative and neutral poles, with a voltage range of +/-0÷400 V. The system integrates a number of DERs, like PV, Wind and Fuel Cell generators, battery and super capacitor based storage systems, EV chargers, standard loads and smart loads. It will include also a power-hardware-in-the-loop platform with the aim to enable the real time emulation of single components or parts of the microgrid, or of systems and sub-systems interacting with the microgrid, thus realizing a virtual extension of the scale of the system.

Firstly, the proposed sensor has higher dynamic range and linearity for displacement sensing. Secondly, compared with previous designs, where the displacement changes both the resonant frequency and depth of the transmission notch, the proposed sensor has a fixed resonant frequency. This is an important improvement since the sensor can be operated at a single fixed frequency and bypass the need for a frequency-sweeping microwave source and measurement system such as an expensive network analyzer. It is shown that, while preserving the compact size, the proposed sensor also benefits from a lower operating frequency.

The amount of oil vapor was decreased by the magnetic field gradient, and the reduction ratio depended on the environmental temperature. The amount of oil vapor from the actual pivot bearing unit could be reduced by the ring magnet around the pivot unit. Finally, our results suggested the possibility of a gas seal generated by the magnetic field gradient for the pivot bearing unit in HDDs.","0018-9464;00189464","","10.1109/TMAG.2015.2511740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368202","Diamagnetism;Hard disk drive;Pivot bearing;hard disk drive (HDD);oil vapor;pivot bearing","Films;Force;Magnetic fields;Magnetic flux;Magnetic levitation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Seals","diamagnetism;disc drives;greases;hard discs;lubricating oils;machine bearings;magnetic fields;permanent magnets;seals (stoppers)","HDD;diamagnetic oil seal;disk surfaces;environmental temperature;grease oil diamagnetism;hard disk drives;magnetic field gradient;oil vapors;permanent magnets;pivot bearing unit;reduction ratio;ring magnet","","","","4","","20151229","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The relays are non-regenerative and apply a space-time code (STC) to the interfered signal. Subsequently, the relays broadcast the coded signals. At the destinations the interfered and ST-coded signals are decoded in two stages. First by decoding the STC, and then by applying successive interference cancellation (SIC).

One of the most important features of the CR is the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), where the CR have some autonomy to make decisions about the spectrum usage. First, the CR must know common laws and regulations concerning spectrum access prescribed by the regulator and must obey them in the decision making process. The typical way to define CR what, when and where should or must be done is providing a policy. The spectrum policy is not only one which drives the CR behaviour. In this paper we describe a set of polices, which can be used to control the CR work at different levels. We also present how to use policies to tune the CR decision making process. We focus on operational usage of the policies implemented in CR, and operational assessment of services used in different types of missions, by definition of the mission service utility function.

A motivation of study comes from the prevalent of switching behavior among banking consumers. For instance, a lack of adoption of new services offered in banking services by customers is one of the important risks in the modern banking. Lack of attention to this risk may lead to serious financial harms and failures. This kind of study is a relatively unexplored research issue and investigation needs to be made specifically from a developing country such as Malaysia, provides interesting evidence on this aspect of banking services. A survey is conducted in this study and the number of respondents was about 100 customers. The key findings show that bank switching is strongly influenced by three types of incident; pricing, inconvenience and core service failures; with pricing being more influential.","2378-9808;23789808","","10.1109/SHUSER.2012.6268802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6268802","Banking Industry;Consumer and Malaysia;Switching Behavior","Banking;Correlation;Medical services;Online banking;Pricing;Switches","","","","0","","33","","","24-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First we analyse the possibilities for TSO cooperation on reserves dispatch and procurement, with a focus on European network codes. Then we propose a model that theoretically analyses cross-border reserve cooperation. We distinguish two degrees of cooperation: reserves exchange and reserves sharing. Our model first determines the non-cooperative TSO equilibrium i.e. the autarkic provision of reserves. Next we compare this with the socially optimal (cooperative) policy of generation reserves procurement. The paper shows why reserves sharing is economically superior to reserves exchange. Sharing allows cost arbitrage and pooling of reserve needs while reserves exchange only takes care of cost arbitrage. The benefits of reserves exchange and reserves sharing depends on cost asymmetry and correlation of reserve needs between the TSO zones.","","","10.1109/ENERGYCON.2016.7513949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7513949","Cross-border balancing;generation reserves;multi-TSO interactions;power system reliability","Analytical models;Europe;Frequency control;Power system reliability;Procurement;Reliability","power generation dispatch;power transmission reliability;procurement","European network code;analyses reliability management;autarkic provision;cost arbitrage;cross-border balancing;crossborder reserve cooperation;generation reserves procurement policy;multiTSO system reliability;noncooperative TSO equilibrium;reserves dispatch;reserves exchange;reserves sharing;stylized analytical model;transmission system operator","","","","","","","4-8 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal in this paper is to develop a transition model of reasoning about agency that achieves three important goals. First, we aim to specify the different kinds of knowledge that is likely to be accessed when people reason about agents. Second, we specify the circumstances under which these different kinds of knowledge might be accessed and be changed. Finally, we discuss how this knowledge might affect basic psychological processes of attention and memory. Our approach will be to first describe the transition model, then to discuss how it might be applied in two specific domains: computer interfaces that allow a single operator to track multiple robots, and a teachable agent system currently in use assisting primary and middle school students in learning natural science concepts.","2167-2121;21672121","","10.1109/HRI.2013.6483612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483612","Concepts;HRI;Theory of Mind","Cognition;Computers;Educational institutions;Legged locomotion;Psychology;Switches","cognition;computer interfaces;educational institutions;educational robots;human-robot interaction;inference mechanisms;mobile agents;psychology;teaching","agency-reasoning;agent reasoning;cognition transition model;computer interfaces;human-robot interaction;middle school students;natural science concept learning;people concepts;primary school students;psychological attention processes;psychological memory processes;systematic reasoning model;teachable agent system;visual attention","","0","","43","","","3-6 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we describe a robust, model-based algorithm and use a linear dispersion model to perform shear wave dispersion analysis in traditionally difficult-to-image subjects. In a cohort of 135 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients, we compare the performance of group SWS with dispersion analysis-derived phase velocity c(200 Hz) and dispersion slope dc/df parameters to stage hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Area under the ROC curve (AUROC) analysis demonstrates correlation between all parameters [group SWS, c(200 Hz), and, to a lesser extent dc/df ] and fibrosis stage, whereas no correlation was observed between steatosis stage and any of the material parameters. Interestingly, optimal AUROC threshold SWS values separating advanced liver fibrosis (≥F3) from mild-to-moderate fibrosis (≤F2) were shown to be frequency-dependent, and to increase from 1.8 to 3.3 m/s over the 0 to 400 Hz shear wave frequency range.","0885-3010;08853010","","10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7002935","","Acoustics;Analytical models;Data models;Dispersion;Frequency measurement;Liver;Materials","biomechanics;elastic constants;elastic waves;liver;viscoelasticity","ROC curve;broadband shear waves;dispersion analysis-derived phase velocity;dispersion slope parameters;frequency 0 Hz to 400 Hz;group shear wave speed performance;hepatic fibrosis staging;hepatic steatosis staging;higher-order material models;human liver;linear dispersion model;model-based algorithm;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients;optimal AUROC threshold shear wave speed;purely elastic material models;shear wave dispersion analysis;shear wave frequency;shear wave imaging systems;soft tissues;stiffness parameters;viscoelastic properties","","6","","35","","","January 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Today programs are built on top of functionalities provided by software platforms. Most often, developers extend existing systems rather than develop from scratch. Programming with application program interfaces (API) that allow newly written code to call middleware or existing application software has become a norm in software industries. While the details of API mechanisms heavily depend on a specific platform or application, the principles behind API design are universal, and can be taught in project courses designed for that purpose.

Instead of CMOS substitution, additional functionality is added by a coprocessor architecture as a prospective back-end-of-line (BEOL) process.

While the CdTe industry has enjoyed great success with material grown at these relatively low temperatures, there may be significant benefits to higher deposition temperatures enabled by a high strain point glass. To demonstrate the efficiency benefits of a CdTe cell fabricated at higher deposition temperatures, it is necessary to re-optimize the device fabrication process steps for devices made with CdTe films at each deposition temperature.

In addition to these physical interfaces, for security reasons, virtual interfaces are typically available, capable of maintaining virtual private connections to company, home or other community networks. Using these interfaces simultaneously is an idea that received a lot of attention from the research community. Yet, to assure user privacy, data confidentiality and to prevent information leaks, applications should not arbitrarily choose any of these interfaces, but should rather follow a pre-defined security policy. We discuss the impact of security considerations on the interface selection process and argue that previous proposals have largely ignored the security-mandated constraints. Beyond the question of choice, a general and user-friendly usage of several IP interfaces in parallel is largely unsupported on the modern OS. In this paper, we therefore design a network-independent architecture that enables a user to assign any network application, even in its runtime, to any available interface including virtual interfaces and independently of destination and source IP addresses. To validate our ideas, we implement the proposed solution under Linux. Our experiments show that the overhead of the solution is negligible in terms of network performance.","","","10.1109/SAR-SSI.2011.5931381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5931381","","Bandwidth;IP networks;Linux;Network interfaces;Routing;Security;Virtual private networks","IP networks;Internet;Linux;computer network security;data privacy;laptop computers;network interfaces;notebook computers;virtual private networks","Internet access;Linux;data confidentiality;information leaks;interface selection process;laptops;modem OS;multiple IP interfaces;multiple network interfaces;netbooks;network authorities;network providers;network-independent architecture;network-independent support;security policy;security reasons;security-mandated constraints;smartphones;source IP addresses;user privacy;user-friendly usage;virtual interfaces;virtual private connections","","0","2","15","","","18-21 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present an experimental study of fault tolerance by means of software in AUTOSAR based system. The aim of the experiment is to investigate how fault tolerance mechanism can be implemented in AUTOSAR based system.

"Robust and Scalable Management of Power Networks in Dual-Source Trolleybus Systems: A Consensus Control Framework","D. Zhang; J. Jiang; L. Y. Wang; W.

Their mobility and power supply network configurations introduce challenging power management issues on their dedicated supply power grids. To ensure safe, reliable, and efficient operation of trolleybuses, their high-current and dynamic loads must be distributed to the feeders properly and promptly. Based on certain emerging networks of feeders and supply stations for city trolleybus systems, this paper introduces a new framework for current flow balancing based on recently developed weighted-and-constrained consensus control methods to manage the power supply network. Using only neighborhood information exchange among feeder lines in the network, the consensus control can achieve global current balancing with fast convergence to a balanced state, robustness to load perturbations, reconfiguration with feeder addition and deletion, and rebalancing under feeder capacity variation. The methodology is scalable in the sense that system expansion will not substantially increase the control system complexity. The power system configurations of the Beijing dual-source trolleybus system are used for simulation case studies on the new power management methods. Robustness and scalability are demonstrated, together with discussions on the feasibility, flexibility, and implementation issues of the methodology.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2492564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314918","Dual-source trolleybus;consensus control;current flow control;power supply network;robustness;scalability","Artificial neural networks;Batteries;Cities and towns;Noise;Power supplies;Robustness;Vehicles","battery powered vehicles;fuel economy","consensus control framework;control system complexity;cost reduction;dual-source trolleybus system;fuel economy;grid electricity;onboard battery;passenger capacity;power networks scalable management;power supply network;weighted-and-constrained consensus control method","","","","23","","20151102","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Cobalt complex redox couple electrolytes have recently been used to obtain a high open-circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) in dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) because of the positively high redox potential of the electrolyte. However, in some cases, unexpectedly low V<sub>oc</sub> was obtained because the fast back electron transfer reactions from the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface to the redox species, recombination, are occurred. To investigate the recombination suppressible function in dye structure, carbazole dyes with various structural features in each dye component, i.e., bulky appendage in donor group, and alkyl chain length in thiophene linker moiety, were studied.

Tetraplegia is one of the cases where complex and expensive interfaces are used for this issue. One interesting solution for this kind of deficiency consists of using a sip and puff interface. It is a simple and inexpensive method but it has two important limitations that restrict its practical use. The first one is in the reduced degree of freedom. The second one is in the tiring driving process. In order to minimize the driving effort for a given trajectory or for an unknown trajectory, this paper presents an optimal adaptation of the controller parameters. The adaptation could be done statically or dynamically according to the environment requirements. The controller is validated by means of simulations applied to three different cases: 1- the complete pathway is defined, 2- the pathway is divided to sub-paths and 3- the pathway is unknown.

We implement bufferless deflection routing cheaply, requiring the generation of only output multiplexer controls and no backpressure handshakes. Additionally, we use directional channels that help reduce crossbar cost by restricting the number of inputs to the crossbar to three instead of four. When compared to buffered mesh switches, FPGA-based deflection routers are ≈3.5× smaller (HLS-generated switch) and 2.5× faster (clock period) for 32b payloads.

Karri","New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering, USA","2014 International Test Conference","","2014","","","1","8","Scan design is a de facto design-for-testability technique that enhances access during the manufacturing test process. However, it can also be exploited to leak secret information off a secure chip. A mode-reset countermeasure has been used to thwart all the existing scan attacks, as they all rely on switching between the test and normal modes. Recently, the countermeasure was circumvented by a new scan attack that utilizes only the test mode to identify the secret key of an AES chip. However, this test-mode-only attack has overlooked the other test structures, such as a decompressor and a compactor, on the scan path, which act as fortuitous countermeasures against test-mode-only scan attacks. In this work, we present a scan attack analysis for contemporary scan architectures with a stimulus decompressor unit. A stimulus decompressor poses a challenge for the test-mode-only attack, as the bit-flips required to launch the attack may not be created through the decompressor. The problem bears similarities to the test pattern encodability problem, where certain test cubes cannot be delivered due to the correlation induced by the stimulus decompressor. This paper sheds light to the intrinsic connections between the scan attack and the test pattern encodability problem, and presents a new test-mode-only scan attack in the presence of a decompressor of any type. Our analysis on an AES design shows that the proposed attack is successful for contemporary scan architectures.

DNNs have a very high computational requirement, making accelerators a very attractive option. These DNNs have many convolutional layers with different parameters in terms of input/output/kernel sizes as well as input stride. Design constraints usually require a single design for all layers of a given DNN. Thus a key challenge is how to design a common architecture that can perform well for all convolutional layers of a DNN, which can be quite diverse and complex. In this paper we present a flexible yet highly efficient 3D neuron array architecture that is a natural fit for convolutional layers. We also present our technique to optimize its parameters including on-chip buffer sizes for a given set of resource constraint for modern FPGAs. Our experimental results targeting a Virtex-7 FPGA demonstrate that our proposed technique can generate DNN accelerators that can outperform the state-of-the-art solutions, by 22% for 32-bit floating-point MAC implementations, and are far more scalable in terms of compute resources and DNN size.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7459526","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Field programmable gate arrays;Neurons;System-on-chip;Three-dimensional displays","field programmable gate arrays;neural chips;neural net architecture","3D neuron array architecture;DNN accelerators;Virtex-7 FPGA;convolutional deep neural networks;convolutional layers;efficient FPGA acceleration;floating-point MAC;image-related machine learning tasks;input-output-kernel sizes;logical-3D compute array;on-chip buffer sizes;resource constraint;word length 32 bit","","","","8","","","14-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Design of a 2-D magnetizer with the consideration of the z-component of the magnetic field","J. Wanjiku; P. Pillay","","2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","","2015","","","3016","3023","A magnetizer design methodology that takes into account systematic errors such as the variation in flux density (B), and the z-component of the magnetic field (Hz), is proposed. The effect of the sample diameter and the effective length of the yoke, i.e. yoke depth on Hz are analysed. Experimental results at 1.5 T and 60 Hz showed a reduction of 81 %, 72 % and 30 % by a large magnetizer, shielding and reducing the yoke depth from 80 mm to 10 mm, respectively. This was in comparison to an unshielded compact magnetizer. Hz is also dependent on magnetic loading. Furthermore, at 2 T and 60 Hz, magnetic contributions dominated Hz such that the effectiveness of shielding and reducing the yoke depth decreased to 27 % and 4 %, respectively. To achieve these very high flux densities, the magnetizers were designed to be compact (sample diameter of ≤ 100 mm and narrow airgaps of ≤ 2 mm). This reduction in size increases the leakage field above and below the sample to the same level of magnitude as the applied field, which affects the measurement of the magnetic field (H). Two H-coil sizes with a sensitivity difference of 60 % are used to show that the measured H is independent of the coil size, but depends on the leakage field. Their measured core loss difference under pulsating and rotating fields was about 6 %.","2329-3721;23293721","","10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7310082","2-D Measurements;Core Losses;Machine Design;Measurement;Rotational;Systematic Errors","Magnetic cores;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetic flux;Magnetic noise;Magnetic shielding;Saturation magnetization;Windings","coils;magnetic cores;magnetic field measurement;magnetic flux;magnetic leakage;magnetic shielding","2D magnetizer design;flux density;leakage field;magnetic field measurement;magnetic field z-component;yoke depth reduction;yoke shielding","","1","","13","","","20-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cluster has been the dominating system architecture used in most data centers. However, the increasingly diversified data center applications have requirements beyond what the cluster architecture can deliver. For instance, clouding computing requires flexible sharing of all data center resources. Big data applications often need large memory capacity. A few applications can use GPGPU effectively. Existing system might be extended to a certain degree to meet those needs. Those extensions however would often be prohibitively expensive. The paper presents our attempt to design a system using commodity products that can meet the varying needs of many emerging data center applications in a cost-effective way. Our attempt is to create a system by connecting multiple nodes through a PCIe switch and then extend the software stack to support resource sharing among these nodes. In particular, a node can directly use the memory, NIC, and GPGPU of other nodes through the PCIe switch with no or little involvement from other nodes. We build a prototype as our evaluation platform. Our evaluation results indicate that those resources can be shared effectively in many cases. For using remote memory as block device, our prototype system has 5 times bandwidth, 11 times IOPS and 1/12 latency compared with the system connected by 10GigE in average for Orion benchmark; Using remote GPGPU via PCIe switch achieves average 60 times speedup than the case without GPGPU, and the performance loss is also acceptable (its average execution time is 1/3 of local GPGPU) for micro-benchmarks from GPU computing SDK; And using remote NIC via PCIe switch achieves average 95% bandwidth and 1.4 times latency of local NIC in httperf testing. While our prototype system offers multiple benefits, it is not perfect and has a lot room for further optimization and extension. We hope the out- ome presented in this paper will encourage more researchers to join us in designing highly efficient and cost-effective servers.","1530-0897;15300897","","10.1109/HPCA.2013.6522317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522317","","Bandwidth;Bridges;Engines;Prototypes;Resource management;Servers;Switches","computer centres;graphics processing units;pattern clustering","GPGPU;IOPS;Orion benchmark;PCIe switch;block device;clouding computing;cluster architecture;commodity products;cost effective data center servers;data center resources;digitalized information;httperf testing;local NIC;memory capacity;microbenchmarks;multiple nodes;prototype system;remote memory;resource sharing;software stack","","0","","25","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The throughput and capacity limitations of single node solutions have led to the development of clustered deduplication systems. Most implemented clustered inline solutions are trading deduplication ratio versus performance and are willing to miss opportunities to detect redundant data, which a single node system would detect. We present an inline deduplication cluster with a joint distributed chunk index, which is able to detect as much redundancy as a single node solution. The use of locality and load balancing paradigms enables the nodes to minimize information exchange. Therefore, we are able to show that, despite different claims in previous papers, it is possible to combine exact deduplication, small chunk sizes, and scalability within one environment using only a commodity GBit Ethernet interconnect. Additionally, we investigate the throughput and scalability limitations with a special focus on the intra-node communication.","2160-195X;2160195X","","10.1109/MSST.2012.6232380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6232380","","Containers;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Home appliances;Indexes;Load management;Throughput","business data processing;electronic data interchange;local area networks;pattern clustering;resource allocation;storage management","capacity limitation;chunk size;clustered deduplication system;commodity GBit Ethernet interconnect;deduplication ratio;distributed chunk index;enterprise storage environment;exact data deduplication cluster design;information exchange;inline deduplication cluster;intra-node communication;load balancing;locality;redundant data;scalability limitation;single node solution;throughput","","6","","43","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) has been in development for decades to control optical transport networks. However, it is extremely difficult to deploy in real operational products, as there is still much non-GMPLS-capable equipment. On the other hand, OpenFlow (OF), one of the most widely used software defined networking implementations, can be used as a UCP for packet and circuit switched networks [“Packet and circuit network convergence with OpenFlow,” in OFC/ NFOEC, Mar. 2010]. In this paper, we propose and experimentally evaluate two solutions using OF to control both packet and optical networks (OpenFlow Messages Mapping and OpenFlow Extension). The overall feasibility of these solutions is assessed, and their performance is evaluated and compared with the GMPLS approach, using a custom-built simulator.

However, the two well-developed theories may not fully induce compliance behavior of ISSP given the growing trend of IS security violation in China. Deterrence and rational choice calculus employ an assumption of general awareness of ISSP to address compliance behavior. However, employees may judge their compliance behavior of ISSP in terms of positive and negative emotions but not the trade-off of benefits and costs (risks) only in the compliance. Grounded in regulatory focus theory (RFT), we propose a research model that addresses the motivational mechanisms for employees to comply with ISSP. We adopt a scenario-based questionnaire to survey employees of Chinese SMEs for model testing. The empirical results indicate that promotion-approach is better than promotion-avoidance in motivating compliance intention when employees are aware of the ISSP in their companies. However, promotion-approach and promotion-avoidance are ineffective in inducing compliance intention when employees are unaware of ISSP in Chinese SMEs. Information security awareness is not a necessary condition of the compliance of ISSP. Additionally, prevention-approach is better than prevention-avoidance in motivating compliance intention regardless of whether employees are aware or unaware of ISSP in the workplace. Our empirical results can provide meaningful implications for academics and practitioners.","","","10.1109/INFOMAN.2016.7477543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7477543","compliance;information systems security policy (ISSP);prevention;promotion;regulatory focus theory (RFT)","Context;Employment;Europe;Reliability;Security","information systems;personnel;security of data;small-to-medium enterprises","Chinese SME;IS security violation;ISSP;RFT;compliance behavior;compliance intention;employees;information systems security policy;model testing;motivational mechanisms;prevention mechanisms;promotion mechanisms;promotion-approach;promotion-avoidance;rational choice calculus theories;regulatory focus theory","","","","25","","","7-8 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these films had off-stoichiometric composition because of re-evaporations of Te and S. In order to prevent the re-evaporations, we developed a face-to-face solid phase epitaxy (SPE) for the fabrication of Fe(Te, S) epitaxial thin films. In the face-to-face SPE method, amorphous Fe(Te, S) films were fabricated by the second harmonic Nd:YAG pulsed laser deposition method at room temperature. The surface of an amorphous film was covered by that of another film and the sample was sandwiched by two stainless plates and uniformly fixed. Then, the sandwiched sample was heat-treated in Ar gas flow. As a result, the face-to-face SPE method enabled to maintain the stoichiometric composition and to obtain Fe(Te, S) epitaxial films with good crystallinity. Maximum zero resistance temperature and critical current density at 2 K were 8.0 K and 6600 A/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Certain precipitates grown at the grain boundaries might lower the superconducting properties of our films. Although the superconducting properties are not sufficient, the face-to-face SPE method is an easy way to obtain the stoichiometric epitaxial films of 11-type superconductors.","1051-8223;10518223","","10.1109/TASC.2012.2228291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6353901","Iron-based superconductor;pulsed laser deposition;solid phase epitaxy;superconducting thin films","Conductivity;Epitaxial growth;Heating;Pulsed laser deposition;Substrates;Superconductivity","amorphous state;critical current density (superconductivity);electrical resistivity;grain boundaries;heat treatment;high-temperature superconductors;iron compounds;pulsed laser deposition;solid phase epitaxial growth;stoichiometry;superconducting epitaxial layers","11-type superconductors;Ar gas flow;Fe(TeS);amorphous films;critical current density;crystallinity;epitaxial thin films;face-to-face SPE method;face-to-face solid phase epitaxial growth;grain boundaries;heat-treatment;maximum zero resistance temperature;off-stoichiometric composition;precipitates;reevaporation;second harmonic pulsed laser deposition;stainless plates;superconducting properties;temperature 2 K;temperature 293 K to 298 K;uniformly fixed sandwiched sample","","3","","17","","20121115","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, network simulations could be inaccurate if VMs are not scheduled according to virtual time, especially when many VMs are hosted per simulator core in a multi-core simulator environment. Since VMs are by default free-running, on the outset, it is not clear if, and to what extent, their untamed execution affects the results in simulated scenarios. Here, we provide the first quantitative basis for establishing the need for generalized virtual time scheduling of VMs in network simulators, based on an actual prototyped implementations. To exercise breadth, our system is tested with disparate applications: (a) a set of message passing parallel programs, (b) a computer worm propagation phenomenon, and (c) a mobile ad-hoc wireless network simulation. We define and use error metrics and benchmarks in scaled tests to empirically report the poor match of traditional, fairness-based VM scheduling to VM-based network simulation, and also clearly show the better performance of our simulation-specific scheduler, with up to 64 VMs hosted on a 12-core simulator node.","1526-7539;15267539","","10.1109/MASCOTS.2012.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298166","Ad-hoc Wireless;High-fidelity;MPI;Multi-core;Network Simulation;Time Synchronization;Virtual Machines","Ad hoc networks;Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Measurement;Multiplexing;Processor scheduling;Virtual machine monitors","invasive software;message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;multiprocessing systems;parallel programming;scheduling;virtual machines","12-core simulator node;VM-based network simulation;computer worm propagation phenomenon;consumer nodes;error metrics;fairness-based VM scheduling;message passing parallel programs;mobile ad-hoc wireless network simulation;multicore simulator environment;scalable network simulators;simulator core;traffic producer;virtual machines;virtual time-based scheduling;wild horse taming","","4","","28","","","7-9 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Single chip capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) arrays fabricated on front-end CMOS electronics with simplified electrical interconnect have been previously developed for highly flexible and compact catheters. In this study, we present a custom built real time imaging system utilizing catheters with single chip CMUT-on-CMOS arrays and show initial imaging results. The fabricated array has a dual-ring structure with 64 transmit (Tx) and 56 receive (Rx) elements. The CMUT arrays fit on a 2.1 mm diameter circular region with all the required front-end electronics. The device operates at 12 MHz center frequency and has around 20 V collapse voltage. The single-chip system requires 13 external connections including 4 Rx channels and power lines. The electrical connections to micro cables in the catheter are made from the top side of the chip using polyimide flex tapes. The device is placed on a 6-Fr catheter shaft and secured with a medical grade silicon rubber. For real time data acquisition, we developed a custom design FPGA based imaging platform to generate digital control sequences for the chip and collect RF data from Rx outputs. We performed imaging experiments using wire phantoms immersed in water to test the real time imaging system. The system has the potential to generate images at 32 fps rate with the particular catheter. The overall system is fully functional and shows promising image performance.","","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7329607","CMUT;Forward Looking;Intravascular;intracardiac echocariography;real time;single chip;ultrasound","Arrays;Catheters;Flexible printed circuits;Gold;Imaging;Polyimides;Real-time systems","CMOS integrated circuits;bioelectric phenomena;biomedical electronics;biomedical transducers;catheters;data acquisition;echocardiography;field programmable gate arrays;medical image processing;micromachining;phantoms;power cables;rubber;ultrasonic imaging;ultrasonic transducers","56 receive elements;6-Fr catheter shaft;64 transmit elements;RF data;circular region;custom built real time imaging system;custom design FPGA based imaging platform;digital control sequences;dual-ring structure;electrical interconnect;forward looking imaging catheters;frequency 12 MHz;front-end CMOS electronics;front-end electronics;highly flexible-compact catheters;image performance;intracardiac echocardiography applications;intravascular ultrasound applications;medical grade silicon rubber;phantoms;polyimide flex tapes;power lines;real time data acquisition;real-time imaging system;single chip CMUT-on-CMOS array;single chip capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer arrays","","1","","7","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It includes all energy carriers, such as electricity and gas, and the flexibilization of energy consumption, given the fact that renewable energies are mostly intermittent and causing fluctuating generation. Optimization and flexibilization of future energy systems require energy management systems that optimize energy flows on all levels of the energy system and across all energy carriers autonomously. So far, flexibilization focuses mainly on electricity consumption and generation. This paper presents hybrid household appliances and an integrated optimization of all different energy carriers as an important possibility of using building for the flexibilization of energy consumption and electricity feed-in into the distribution grid. Bottom-up simulations of households with energy management systems that optimize energy generation and consumption with respect to all carriers show an increase of the flexibilization of energy consumption as well as an increase of the self-consumption and self-sufficiency that will help to enable the transition in the energy system.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7388476","","","","","","","","","","","17-18 Nov. 2015","","VDE","VDE Conference Publications"

Most of transmission outage and switching analysis is solely based on system reliability criteria without much consideration of market efficiency or any systematic economic evaluation. As the global movement of smart grid progresses with stronger, more flexible and more efficient transmission systems, RTOs have started using economic analysis tool to evaluate economic impacts of outage in order to improve overall market efficiency. On the other hand, optimal transmission switching seems to be a viable way to leverage grid controllability and enhance system performance. In this paper, we discuss the process of outage coordination and a measure of economic evaluation, review the basic concept of optimal transmission switching and discuss some of its market design and implementation challenges.","1932-5517;19325517","","10.1109/PES.2011.6039831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6039831","Market efficiency;market monitoring;market operations;outage coordination;smart grid;transmission switching","Computational modeling;Economics;Generators;Load flow;Production;Reliability;Switches","power grids;power transmission economics;power transmission reliability","RTO;economic evaluation;grid controllability;market economics optimization;optimal transmission switching;reliability;system operations;transmission outages","","4","","14","","","24-29 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The integrated sensing electronics consist of a front-end multiplexer that can sequentially connect individual sensing nodes in a GRSC to a capacitance-to-voltage converter followed by an ADC, digital control unit, and driving circuitry to interrogate the GRSC. The characterization data shows that the single-ended (z-axis pressure) mode exhibits a large output interference due to the un-matched interconnect traces design, thus limiting sensing resolution to 8 bits. The differential mode (x/y-axes shear strain) shows a reduced interference effect, achieving a 10-bit resolution.","1930-0395;19300395","","10.1109/ICSENS.2012.6411379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6411379","","Arrays;Capacitance;Capacitors;Interference;Navigation;Sensors;Strain","electromagnetic interference;position measurement;sensor fusion","capacitance-to-voltage converter;dynamic ground forces;electrical interferences;front-end multiplexer;ground reaction sensor cluster;high-resolution error-correcting biomechanical;inertial measurement unit;integrated sensing electronics;position sensing accuracy;shear strains;sole deformation","","5","1","11","","","28-31 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IEEE 802.16j emerged as a standard in the middle of 2009, specifying the procedure of supporting Mobile Multi-hop Relay (MMR) networks. The use of the “multi-hop” architectures not only requires a re-design of the functional implementations of both physical and link layers, because the topology in such networks is fundamentally different from that of single hop, but also necessitates further investigation of other “non-functional” properties, such as end-to-end packet delay performance, which is one of the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and is considered to be critical for the future success of multi-hop network deployment. In this paper we report the development of a new Matlab/Simulink cross-layer simulation platform for integration on top of the IEEE 802.16 PHY standard model, and will use Effective Capacity (EC) multi-hop model to evaluate and analyse the multi-hop end-to-end link-layer packet delay performance.

However, they are based on nondegenerate carriers, and their operating temperature is limited to higher than 100 K due to freeze-out of carriers. Being based on degenerate carriers, the HEMT has no low-temperature limit. Here, we report on the experimental results of specially designed HEMTs made at CNRS/LPN. These HEMTs, with different input capacitances from 92 pF to 5.3 pF, have been characterized from 4.2 K to 77 K, and show a power consumption of 100 μW or below. At 4.2 K, the lowest input noise voltage, 6 nV/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> at 1 Hz, has been obtained with the HEMT having the largest input capacitance; the lowest input noise current of about 3 aA/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> at 1 Hz has been observed with the HEMT with the smallest input capacitance; and the white noise voltage in these HEMTs is of about 0.2 nV/Hz<sup>1/2</sup>. By increasing the temperature from 4.2 K to 77 K, noise voltage and noise current increase, but their values are limited within a factor of about 3 compared to their lowest values at 4.2 K.

"Safeguarding trafficability of a wheeled, snake-like reconnaissance robot on rough terrain by a shared control system based on fuzzy logic","P.

They must be able to navigate through a given environment and to avoid insurmountable obstacles. Further on, they must have the ability to negotiate a wide spectrum of obstacles including e.g. wide gaps and high steps. Finally, they must be able to traverse different forms of ground without getting immobilized by a loss of traction. These abilities can be described as a mobile robot's performance indices “maneuverability”, “terrainability” and “trafficability”. High potentials with regard to mobility in unstructured and rough environments offer snake-like, kinematically redundant robots equipped with powered wheels or tracks. These potentials are based on the systems' design. Due to their slender, modular and flexible built-up the systems are basically able to travel and maneuver through noticeable narrow passes and tunnels. Further on, their kinematic redundancy can be used for a purposeful posture and terrain adaptation to safeguard traction and the system's trafficability, respectively. Finally, the systems' modular and articulated design, both, can be used to achieve an outstanding terrainability and to be able to negotiate remarkable obstacles. The described and expected potentials have to be investigated in detail as well as evaluated in practice. The paper at hand describes a wheeled, snake-like reconnaissance robot developed for this purpose. The system is equipped with a shared control system to safeguard its efficient mobility with respect to the performance indices maneuverability, terrainability and trafficability, both, on structured and rough terrain. The developed shared control system is presented focusing on the control of the system's trafficability. The involved - ontrol strategy is based on fuzzy logic.

The study of the ecosystems, especially those located along the active faults where methane and hydrogen sulphide are emitted, is an interesting research topic.

The MARDEP observatory infrastructure has been developed under ESONET NoE project using the ESONET label. It is designed as three fixed modular units located on different fault segments, each connected to a shore station with a buried cable. The observatory will therefore be with real-time data transmission and powered from the shore. The observation sites were selected after detailed site surveys. The design involves nodes and junction boxes and other standards (e.g., Ethernet, serial interface, clock synchronization), adaptable to new developments.

We extend the application to the generic case and present a simple updating methodology for the estimation of the model parameters.","","","10.1109/SCAT.2013.7055107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7055107","","Bayes methods;Educational institutions;Information science;Probability distribution;Silicon;Telecommunications","Bayes methods;estimation theory;forecasting theory;gamma distribution;parameter estimation","Bayesian analysis;Bayesian updating methodology;average stay time estimation;gamma probability distribution;model parameter estimation;traffic evaluation","","0","","4","","","13-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Modeling and Optimal Low-Power On–Off Control of Thin-Film Piezoelectric Rotational Actuators","B. Edamana; B. Hahn; J. S. Pulskamp; R. G. Polcawich; K. Oldham","Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA","IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","","2011","16","5","884","896","A novel open-loop minimal energy on-off servo system and control strategy are described for ensuring specified displacements from new microscale piezoelectric rotational joints under extremely strict power budgets. The rotational joints are driven by thin-film lead-zirconate-titanate actuators and are targeted for use in autonomous terrestrial microrobots. A lumped-parameter, second-order model of anticipated joint behavior is utilized to estimate the natural frequency and damping ratio of the robot joints, which, in turn, are used to identify necessary sampling rates and switching drive circuit parameters for implementation of on-off control. An identified model of leg joint behavior is then used to both verify lumped-parameter modeling and to optimize on-off input sequences to the rotary joint. The optimization procedure incorporates energy costs from both switching and holding an input voltage on microactuators that behave as a capacitive load, while ensuring that specified final states of a dynamic system are achieved at a specified point in time. Optimization is done via a new application of binary programming. In addition, modest robustness of the system response to parameter variation can be produced during control sequence generation. Optimized input sequences are applied to both macroscale piezoelectric actuators and to prototype thin-film piezoelectric leg joints, and show that specified actuator motions can be achieved with energy consumption of less than 5 μJ per movement.","1083-4435;10834435","","10.1109/TMECH.2010.2053041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5518416","Integer programming;microactuators;microelectromechanical devices;on–off control;piezoelectric devices;switched systems","Control systems;Frequency estimation;Microactuators;Microelectromechanical systems;Open loop systems;Optimal control;Piezoelectric actuators;Servomechanisms;Switched systems","integer programming;lumped parameter networks;microactuators;microrobots;on-off control;optimal control;piezoelectric actuators;power control","anticipated joint behavior;autonomous terrestrial microrobots;binary programming;leg joint behavior;lumped-parameter modeling;microactuators;open-loop minimal energy on-off servo system;optimal low-power on-off control;thin-film piezoelectric rotational actuators","","11","","23","","20100723","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The strain gages with uniform resistance are obtained by growing an epi-silicon layer on a single crystal silicon wafer using epitaxial deposition technique rather than conventional photolithography and etching techniques. The inorganic micro-fused glass frits are used as the bonding material between the strain gages and the 17-4PH SS diaphragm. Compared to organic adhesives, the glass frits bonding material can minimize the hysteresis error in the high temperature applications and improve the mechanical properties of semiconductor strain gage based pressure transducers. After wire bonds being made between the two half bridge strain gages and an interface printed circuit board (PCB), the output characteristics of sensors are evaluated. Results show that the sensors exhibit a stable output with 0.045% full-scale (FS) hysteresis error, and linearity and repeatability are less than 0.04% FS 0.12% FS at the room temperature. Furthermore, the output performance of sensors in the high temperature of 125 °C almost equals that of the room temperature, which indicates that the glass frit bonding is a good method which would lead to a significant advance in the high temperature applicability of silicon strain gage transducers.","","","10.1109/ICEPT-HDP.2012.6474909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474909","","Abstracts;Educational institutions;Epitaxial growth;Periodic structures;Reliability;Temperature;Temperature sensors","pressure sensors;pressure transducers;printed circuits;silicon;stainless steel;strain gauges","17-4PH SS diaphragm;17-4PH stainless steel diaphragm;FS hysteresis error;Si;bonding material;epi-silicon layer;epitaxial deposition technique;etching techniques;full-scale hysteresis error;glass frit bonding material;half bridge strain gages;inorganic microfused glass frit technology;interface PCB;interface printed circuit board;organic adhesives;photolithography techniques;pressure transducers;semiconductor strain gage mechanical properties;silicon strain gage transducers;single crystal silicon wafer;steel pressure sensor;temperature 125 degC;temperature 293 K to 298 K","","0","","13","","","13-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several technologies have been suggested to meet communication needs for the backhaul that connects customer data collection points with the utility's control center. In this paper, these technologies are compared with a justification of why wireless communication technologies may be most suitable for the backhaul. A linear chain multihop wireless communication architecture is then proposed, and its ability to meet application requirements of the communication backhaul is evaluated through simulations. Based on capacity limitations first seen in the simulation results, a theoretical analysis is done to understand the data carrying capacity of using linear chain wireless technologies for the communication backhaul.

Knowledge is considered actionable if users can take direct actions based on such knowledge to their advantage. Among the most important and distinctive actionable knowledge are actionable behavioral rules that can directly and explicitly suggest specific actions to take to influence (restrain or encourage) the behavior in the users' best interest. The problem of mining such rules is a search problem in a framework of support and expected utility. The previous definition of a rule's support assumes that each instance which supports a rule has the uniform contribution to the support. However, this assumption is usually violated in practice to some extent, and thus will hinder the performance of algorithms for mining such rules. In this paper, to handle this problem, an observation-weighting model for support and corresponding mining algorithm are proposed. The experimental results strongly suggest the validity and the superiority of our approach.","","","10.1109/ICACI.2015.7184761","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7184761","","Electronic mail;Training","data mining","actionable behavioral rules mining;actionable knowledge;data mining;mined patterns;mining algorithm;observation-weighting method;observation-weighting model;rule support;search problem","","0","","20","","","27-29 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Images of human faces and bodies suffer from the inversion effect whereas images of objects do not. The effect may be caused by the configural processing of faces and body postures, which is dependent on the perception of spatial relations between different parts of the stimuli. We investigated if the inversion effect applies to images of robots in the hope of using it as a measurement tool for robot's anthropomorphism. The results suggest that robots, similarly to humans, are subject to the inversion effect. Furthermore, there is a significant, but weak linear relationship between the recognition accuracy and perceived anthropomorphism. The small variance explained by the inversion effect renders this test inferior to the questionnaire based Godspeed Anthropomorphism Scale.","2167-2121;21672121","","10.1109/HRI.2013.6483611","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483611","anthropomorphism;human-robot interaction;inversion effect;methodology","Accuracy;Anthropomorphism;Atmospheric measurements;Face recognition;Image recognition;Particle measurements;Robots","face recognition;human factors;human-robot interaction;robot vision","body postures;configural processing;human body image;human face image;image recognition;inversion effect;measurement tool;perceived anthropomorphism;questionnaire based Godspeed anthropomorphism scale;robot anthropomorphism;spatial relation perception","","1","","38","","","3-6 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we we propose an alternative approach based on a multilayer representation using an is-a relation instead. This is cognitively more adequate and allows to use standard reasoning mechanisms. We show how OWL-FA enables a semantic representation of the metamodel in an ontology, providing decidable reasoners.

The methodology models windings, lamination and slot insulation as three distinct regions and formulates a boundary value problem for each region. The solutions follow Poisson's and Laplace's equations. The closed-form nature of the solution allows it to be used for electric machine design and protection. The model is compared with a lumped parameter model, and verified using three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental measurements on a linear induction machine. Slot temperature predictions using the proposed model are within 3.2% of FEA. Model temperature estimates in the slot, lamination, and end winding are all within 6.7% of experimental measurements. This temperature estimation accuracy suggests that the proposed approach is suitable for applications where fast and flexible thermal modeling is necessary.","","","10.1109/IEMDC.2013.6556184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6556184","","Analytical models;Copper;Heat transfer;Heating;Lamination;Stator windings","Laplace equations;Poisson equation;asynchronous machines;boundary-value problems;finite element analysis;linear machines;machine insulation;stators","FEA;Laplace equations;Poisson equations;boundary value problem;closed-form analytical solution;electric machine design;electric machine protection;lamination;linear induction machine;linear stator structure;rectangular slot structure;slot insulation;temperature distribution;temperature estimation;thermal modeling;three-dimensional finite element analysis;windings","","0","","21","","","12-15 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this dependability, security must be designed-in rather than relying on hardening of systems post implementation. This is also expected to minimise the costs of security. The European ATM modernisation programme, SESAR, has been taking a systems engineering approach to ensure that R&D is rapidly transferred to industrialisation and then deployment. This approach has been applied to security, organised around `operational focus areas' that represent discrete operational improvements. In such a complex programme, traditional risk analysis and mitigation was thought to be limited when attempting a system wide coherence for security. Hence the SESAR programme is adopting a `security case' approach, drawing on lessons learned in safety cases, validation & verification of ATM R&D, and aligned to the system engineering approach.","2155-4943;21554943","","10.1109/ICNSurv.2012.6218393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218393","","Aircraft navigation;Europe;Resilience;Safety;Security;Systems engineering and theory","air traffic;research and development;risk analysis;security of data;systems engineering","European ATM modernisation programme;SESAR security 2020;dependability level;discrete operational improvements;global air traffic management;industrialisation;research and development;risk analysis;risk mitigation;system wide coherence;system-of-systems engineering","","7","","18","","","24-26 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

BCI systems based on motor imagery often employ feature extraction algorithms based on Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). CSP is capable of discriminating two classes, but it is sensitive to outliers and noisy trials. Therefore, regularisation is often deployed to improve the robustness and accuracy of CSP estimation. In this paper, a novel regularisation approach based on shrinkage estimation is presented in order to handle small sample problem and retain subject-specific discriminative features. In this method, an analytical solution for shrinkage estimation is provided, which not only is computationally tractable, but also overcomes the heuristic approach of traditional cross validation based parameter tuning. We applied the proposed regularisation to Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP). The proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely Wadsworth Physiobank Dataset and BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a.

Six-legs AC/DC/AC converters are normally used in modern wind energy systems like as in the system with a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). A sudden failure of the converter can lead to the total or partial loss of the control of the phase currents and can cause serious system malfunction or shutdown. Therefore, to prevent the spread of the fault to the other system components and to ensure continuity of service, fault tolerant converter topologies associated to quick and effective fault detection and compensation methods must be implemented. In this paper, a fault tolerant AC/DC/AC converter for a wind energy conversion system based on a DFIG is studied. The presented six-legs converter uses an additional leg that replaces the faulty one after the fault detection. An FPGA is used for experimental implementation of the fault detection scheme, to assure the fast fault detection. A rapid prototyping based on an intermediate “FPGA in the loop” step is used for digital implementation. “FPGA in the loop” results as well as fully experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection and fault tolerant control.","","","10.1109/ICIT.2013.6505922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6505922","Fault tolerant converter;Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA);fault detection;wind energy conversion","Fault detection;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Field programmable gate arrays;Switches;Topology;Wind energy","AC-DC power convertors;DC-AC power convertors;asynchronous generators;fault tolerance;field programmable gate arrays;power generation reliability;wind power plants","DFIG;FPGA;digital implementation;doubly-fed induction generator;fault detection;fault tolerant control;fault tolerant converter topologies;open switch fault tolerant six-legs AC-DC-AC converter;partial loss;phase currents;reliability;wind energy conversion system","","0","","16","","","25-28 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a traditional multi-user, multi-application Web hosting environment, typically applications are public by default. Applications wishing to offer a notion of private resources must take it upon themselves to independently manage authentication and authorization of users, leading to difficult and disjointed notions of access and sharing. In such a context, LangSec-based vulnerabilities threaten catastrophic loss of privacy for all users of the system, likely even of non-vulnerable applications. This is a tragic state of affairs, but is thankfully not inevitable! We present the Sandstorm system, a capability-based, private-bydefault, tightly-sandboxing, proactively secure environment for running web applications, complete with a single, pervasive sharing mechanism. Sandstorm, and capability systems, are likely of interest to the LangSec community: LangSec bugs are mitigated through the robust isolation imposed by the Sandstorm supervisor, and the mechanism of capability systems offers the potential to turn difficult authorization decisions into LangSec's bread and butter, namely syntactic constraints on requests: every well-formed request which can be stated is authorized. We present aspects of the Sandstorm system and show how those aspects have, by building systematic protection into several levels of the system, dramatically reduced the severity of LangSec bugs in hosted applications. To study the range of impact, we will characterize addressed vulnerabilities using MITRE's Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) scheme.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3690-5; POD:978-1-5090-3691-2","10.1109/SPW.2016.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7527769","","Authorization;Computer bugs;Databases;Kernel;Privacy","Internet;authorisation;data privacy;program debugging;safety-critical software","LangSec bugs;LangSec community;LangSec-based vulnerabilities;MITRE CWE scheme;MITRE common weakness enumeration scheme;Sandstorm system;authentication;catastrophic privacy loss;multiapplication Web hosting environment;multiuser Web hosting environment;pervasive sharing mechanism;syntactic constraints;user authorization","","","","","","","22-26 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach aims to match the game difficulty to the player skills, keeping proper motivation (flow) during a rehabilitation process. The traditional rehabilitation process involves repetitive exercises. Robots and serious games provide new means to improve user motivation and commitment during treatment. Each person shows different skills when facing the challenges posed by computer games. Thus, the game difficulty level should be adjusted to each player skill level. The Q-Learning algorithm was adapted in this context to modify game parameters and to assess user skills based on a performance function. This function provides a path to an individual difficulty adjustment and consequently a tool to keep the user exercising. Experiments with thirty minutes duration are presented, involving four players, and the results obtained indicate the proposed approach is feasible for modeling the user behaviour getting to capture the adaptations and trends for each player according to the game difficulties.","","","10.1109/SBR.LARS.Robocontrol.2014.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7024283","AI techniques in robotics;Entertainment Robotics;Healthcare Robotics;Robotic Surgery and Rehabilitation;Service Robotics and Applications","Computers;Games;Learning (artificial intelligence);Medical treatment;Robot kinematics;Wrist","human factors;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;serious games (computing)","Q-learning algorithm;computer games;dynamic player modelling;performance function;player skill modeling;rehabilitation robotics;reinforcement learning approach;repetitive exercises;serious games;user behaviour modeling;user commitment;user motivation","","0","","13","","","18-23 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis approach based on both trajectory and frequency domain information integrated with evolutionary algorithm to achieve the optimal control of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) based wind generation. Instead of optimizing all the control parameters, our key idea is to use the sensitivity analysis to first identify the critical parameters, the unified dominate control parameters (UDCP), to reduce the optimization complexity. Based on such selected parameters, we then use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the optimal values to achieve the control objective.

We propose efficient multicast streaming (EMS) to solve these problems without modifying the AP and the multicast receivers. With EMS, the multicast sender adapts its sending rate at the application layer and adjusts the sleep cycle at the MAC layer by monitoring multicast packets sent from the AP.

Furthermore, the proliferation of optical networking in the last mile led major Telecom unions, such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to emerge energy consumption as a critical objective of the next generation passive optical networks (NG-PONs). In particular, the standardization of the 10-gigabit-capable PON (XG-PON) entails well-defined specifications towards power management and energy reduction, especially regarding the power control of optical terminal devices such as the optical network units (ONUs). In this way, the optical line terminator (OLT) along with ONUs are able to cooperate with each other in order to succeed energy reduction, by applying doze or cyclic sleep periods to idle ONUs. However, the sleep period determination remains a quite challenging research area. In this study, we endeavor to provide XG-PON networks with an effective forecasting mechanism that is capable of estimating the time duration of the forthcoming sleep session. To this end, we apply the exponential smoothing technique to best estimate the sleep duration based on the monitoring time series observations.

Two bowtie GPR transducers are chosen for the simulations and two widely employed antipersonnel (AP) landmines, namely PMA-1 and PMN are used. The validity of the modeled antennas and landmines is tested through a comparison between numerical and laboratory measurements. The modeled AP landmines are buried in a realistically simulated soil. The geometrical characteristics of soil's inhomogeneity are modeled using fractal correlated noise, which gives rise to Gaussian semivariograms often encountered in the field. Fractals are also employed in order to simulate the roughness of the soil's surface. A frequency-dependent complex electrical permittivity model is used for the dielectric properties of the soil, which relates both the velocity and the attenuation of the electromagnetic waves with the soil's bulk density, sand particles density, clay fraction, sand fraction, and volumetric water fraction. Debye functions are employed to simulate this complex electrical permittivity. Background features like vegetation and water puddles are also included in the models and it is shown that they can affect the performance of GPR at frequencies used for landmine detection (0.5-3 GHz). It is envisaged that this modeling framework would be useful as a testbed for developing novel GPR signal processing and interpretations procedures and some preliminary results from using it in such a way are presented.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2468597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229259","Antennas;FDTD;GPR;GprMax;antipersonnel (AP) landmines;bowtie;dispersive;fractals;grass;modeling;roots;rough surface;vegetation;water puddles","Fractals;Ground penetrating radar;Landmine detection;Numerical models;Permittivity;Soil;Time-domain analysis","Gaussian processes;UHF antennas;UHF detectors;finite difference time-domain analysis;fractals;ground penetrating radar;landmine detection;microwave antennas;microwave detectors;radar antennas;transducers","3D FDTD numerical modeling framework;AP landmine detection;Debye functions;GPR signal processing;GPR transducer;Gaussian semivariograms;PMA-1;PMN;antenna;antipersonnel landmine detection;bulk density;clay fraction;dielectric property;electromagnetic wave;fractal correlated noise;frequency 0.5 GHz to 3 GHz;frequency-dependent complex electrical permittivity model;ground penetrating radar;numerical measurement;sand fraction;sand particles density;soil simulation;three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain algorithm;volumetric water fraction","","2","","96","","20150828","Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Often, these devices can't meet the computational requirements of current intrusion prevention mechanisms or designers prioritize additional features and services over security; as a result, many IoT devices are vulnerable to attack. We have developed an ultra-lightweight deep packet anomaly detection approach that is feasible to run on resource constrained IoT devices yet provides good discrimination between normal and abnormal payloads. Feature selection uses efficient bit-pattern matching, requiring only a bitwise AND operation followed by a conditional counter increment. The discrimination function is implemented as a lookup-table, allowing both fast evaluation and flexible feature space representation. Due to its simplicity, the approach can be efficiently implemented in either hardware or software and can be deployed in network appliances, interfaces, or in the protocol stack of a device.

We simulate a system using a finite difference and ray tracing tools and fabricate coarse beam steerer with 65° FOR with ~8° resolution at 1550 nm. We demonstrate high optical throughput (84%-87%) that can be substantially improved by optimizing substrates and electrode materials. This beam steerer can achieve very low sidelobes and supports comparatively large beam diameters paired with a very thin assembly and low beam walk-off.

In this paper, we identify how interconnect on a backside metal layer acts as a back gate of transistors on the adjacent tiers in 3-D fully depleted silicon on insulator technology. The resulting shift in threshold voltage is determined by process and backside interconnect geometries. We develop a framework to evaluate the impact of process parameters. Our results show that coupling due to backside metal results in 5X more electrostatic noise coupling than nearby through-oxide vias. The results also show that the change in threshold voltage of an NFET device increases with thicker front oxide, thinner buried oxide, thinner silicon film, and increased backside metal voltage. Additionally, we simulate the adverse effects of back-gate coupling on circuit performance using a representative analog test circuit, an analog amplifier. We show that the back-gate voltage can change the output of an inverting amplifier by as much as the output swing of the amplifier (0.058 V) under normal operation.","2156-3950;21563950","","10.1109/TCPMT.2013.2272401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587114","3-D integrated circuit (IC);back-gate effect;computer-aided design (CAD);fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI)","Couplings;Logic gates;Noise;Silicon;Solid modeling;Threshold voltage;Transistors","elemental semiconductors;field effect transistors;integrated circuit noise;integrated circuit testing;power consumption;silicon;three-dimensional integrated circuits","3D fully depleted silicon;3D integrated circuits;3D integration;NFET device;Si;analog amplifier;analog test circuit;back gate;back-gate coupling;back-gate voltage;backside interconnect geometries;backside metal layer;backside metal voltage;buried oxide;circuit performance;compact circuitry;electrostatic noise coupling;front oxide;insulator integrated circuits;insulator technology;noise sources;output swing;parasitic back-gate effect;planar IC;power consumption;process parameters;silicon film;threshold voltage;through-oxide vias;transistors","","0","","17","","20130826","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The WS-Eventing is one of this standards within DPWS and enables the distributions of events. However, WS-Eventing has a scalability problem as in ad-hoc networks the notification is transmitted sequential by an event source. Under these circumstances, it is not suitable for large-scale networks with a high amount of devices. Therefore, a new approach is presented to solve this issue by acquiring helping devices. The communication is only based on unicast IP communication and thus is easy to integrate into automation infrastructures and could be established over several subnets. This approach has been investigated with an experimental setup and shows the high scalability compared to the original notification mechanism. Additionally, the real-time capability is given due to the chosen platform and real-time operating system.

Changes in the regulatory framework with respect to planned extensions of extra high voltage (EHV) systems have intensified the demand for underground transmission lines in general. GIL are utilized mainly above ground (e.g. in substations) or in underground tunnels. However, the option of a directly buried GIL which does not need the expenditure of a tunnel has not so far been put into effect in the EHV range, although it exhibits a number of advantages such as high current carrying capacity, low losses, low charging capacity etc. Some years ago a test installation of directly buried GIL proved that the operation of such a system is favourable in many aspects. For this reason, it was decided in 2008 to set up a system for commercial use in the network of German network operator Amprion. In the area of Frankfurt airport, a double system of a directly buried GIL with a total length of about one km has been erected to ensure the safety distance between overhead transmission line (OHL) and the new runway. The GIL containing an N<sub>2</sub>/SF<sub>6</sub> gas mixture is at one end directly connected to a 400 kV gas-insulated substation (GIS).

A key driver in this movement is the recognition that traditional graphics devices can play a larger role in computation than was ever considered before. The high performance computing community has fueled this development, and has demonstrated that Graphics Processing Units can be utilized in a range of general purpose and embedded systems applications.

To enable this, they deploy complex workflows of analytic data flows that access multiple storage repositories and execution engines and that span the enterprise and even outside the enterprise. We call these multi-engine flows hybrid flows. Designing and optimizing hybrid flows is a challenging task. Managing a workload of hybrid flows is even more challenging since their execution engines are likely under different administrative domains and there is no single point of control. To address these needs, we present a Hybrid Flow Management System (HFMS). It is an independent software layer over a number of independent execution engines and storage repositories. It simplifies the design of analytic data flows and includes optimization and executor modules to produce optimized executable flows that can run across multiple execution engines. HFMS dispatches flows for execution and monitors their progress. To meet service level objectives for a workload, it may dynamically change a flow's execution plan to avoid processing bottlenecks in the computing infrastructure. We present the architecture of HFMS and describe its components. To demonstrate its potential benefit, we describe performance results for running sample batch workloads with and without HFMS. The ability to monitor multiple execution engines and to dynamically adjust plans enables HFMS to provide better service guarantees and better system utilization.","1063-6382;10636382","","10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544907","","Business;Connectors;Databases;Engines;Fault tolerance;Monitoring;Optimization","competitive intelligence;data analysis;storage management","HFMS;business intelligence system;complexity management;executor module;hybrid analytic data flow;hybrid flow management system;independent execution engine;independent software layer;lifecycle management;multiengine flows hybrid flow;optimization module;storage repository;system utilization;workload management","","2","","27","","","8-12 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this reason, it is imperative to mitigate these risks by developing counterfeit IC detection techniques, especially at the chip level. In this paper, a novel counterfeit IC detection method is proposed. It is based on the measurement of intrinsic light emission from CMOS ICs that is a strong function of the device threshold voltage (Vt) for a given technology. In contrast to currently available counterfeit IC detection techniques, the proposed method measures IC degradation after it has been used for a long time and does not require a reference IC to provide a baseline signature. A differential technique is used to detect different levels of degradation inside the same chip in order to determine if it is counterfeit. Experimental results presented in this paper show that emission can be effectively used to detect degradation, thus making this technique a very effective way to detect counterfeit ICs.","1089-3539;10893539","","10.1109/TEST.2014.7035356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7035356","","Abstracts;Circuit analysis;Decision support systems;Heating;Industries;Stress","CMOS integrated circuits;counterfeit goods;fraud;integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit testing;light emitting devices;supply chain management","CMOS IC;IC degradation;baseline signature;chip level;counterfeit IC detection techniques;counterfeit integrated circuits;degradation detection;device threshold voltage;differential technique;electronics industry;intrinsic light emission measurement;risks mitigation;supply chain","","1","","28","","","20-23 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A discriminative latent model for Chinese multiword expression extraction","X.

For existing MT systems, especially Statistic based MT(SBMT), the issue of multiword expressions (MWEs) detection and accurate correspondence from source to target language remains an unsolved problem. Template or Super Function based machine translation system suffer less from the existance of MWEs, but MWEs are still main holdback of MT systems. Our initial experiments on the Chinese-Japanese MT systems reveal that, where MWEs exist, SFBMT system suffer in terms of both efficiency ,comprehensibility and adequacy of finding the translation functions. Statistic based Machine Translation suffers more than SFBMT. For SFBMT systems to become of further practical use, they need to be enhanced with MWEs processing capability. As part of our study towards this goal, we proposed a discriminative latent model, which was developed for sequence labeling task, for identifying and extracting Chinese MWEs. In our evaluation, the tool achieved precisions ranging from 71.46% to 95.87% for different types of MWEs. Such results demonstrate that it is feasible to automatically identify many Chinese MWEs using our tool, Super Function based MT will be further improvement after the Chinese MWEs have been detected.","","","10.1109/NLPKE.2011.6138204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6138204","Discriminative Model;Global Feature;Machine Translation;Multiword Expression Extraction;Super Function","Computational modeling;Equations;Inference algorithms;Mathematical model;Natural language processing;Tagging;Training","language translation;natural language processing","Chinese multiword expression extraction;Chinese-Japanese MT system;discriminative latent model;statistic based MT;super function based machine translation;template based machine translation","","0","","31","","","27-29 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on link selection and its improvement of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) throughput with an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) algorithm in comparison with two conventional algorithms of the fixed priority scheme (Priority) and the maximum transmission rate scheme (MaxRate). Because the characteristics of transmission delay influence the behavior of the TCP protocol, the impact of three kinds of delay (RTT: round trip time, DL delay: downlink delay, and UL delay: uplink delay) are compared to find which delay is suitable for a metric of the AHP algorithm.

To meet the needs of such use-cases, a new paradigm, which we call Adhoc computing, is emerging.

Furthermore, it must handle the heterogeneity in devices/OSs, as well as the lack of reliability, security and/or trust of these devices, and must be able to learn and improve over time.

In the case of small-sized caches, we aim to design a content replacement strategy that allows nodes to successfully store newly received information while maintaining the good performance of the content distribution system. Under both conditions, each node takes decisions according to its perception of what nearby users may store in their caches and with the aim of differentiating its own cache content from the other nodes'. The result is the creation of content diversity within the nodes neighborhood so that a requesting user likely finds the desired information nearby.

With the increasing capabilities of Internet-based computing systems to generate, store and process Big Data Streams, various applications are benefiting from the information extracted in real time from data streams. Such families of applications comprise IoT-based monitoring systems, decision making systems, recommendation systems, security, etc. In all of them, the common ingredient is that of using real time data analytics for the purpose at hand. The foremost challenge of processing Big Data Streams is that of throughput performance, i.e., the computing system should be able to compute at high throughput to accommodate the high data stream rate generation in input. Additionally to this challenge, the processing should be such that the consistency of streaming is achieved. The consistency of streaming requires that the order of events in the original stream (in input) is preserved also in the output. In this paper we show that using a heterogeneous cluster for Big Data Stream processing could indeed incur into streaming inconsistency and one would indeed have to carefully tune the system so that streaming consistency is achieved. We exemplify the approach using the Yahoo!S4 for processing the Big Data Stream from FlightRadar24 global flight monitoring system.","","","10.1109/NBiS.2015.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350662","Big Data Stream;Consistency of Streaming;FlightRadar24;Generic Log Adapter;Global Flight Monitoring System;Parallel Data Processing;Real-time Analytics;Yahoo!S4","Aircraft;Airports;Big data;Data mining;Data models;Monitoring;Real-time systems","Big Data;Internet;data analysis;decision making;pattern clustering","FlightRadar24 global flight monitoring system;Internet-based computing systems;IoT-based monitoring systems;Yahoo!S4;big data stream processing;computing system;decision making systems;heterogeneous clusters;information extraction;real time data analytics;recommendation systems;streaming consistency","","","","19","","","2-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system uses the Slope One algorithm for computing individual predictions and the Multiplicative Utilitarian Strategy as a model to recommend to an entire group. We show how we solved all practical aspects of the system; including its architecture and a mobile application for the service, the lack of user data (ramp-up and cold-start problems), the scaling fit of the group model strategy, and other improvements in order to reduce the response time.

Tao","Shanghai Jiao Tong University","IEEE Wireless Communications","","2014","21","6","118","125","The flux of social media and the convenience of mobile connectivity have created a mobile data phenomenon that is expected to overwhelm mobile cellular networks in the foreseeable future. Despite the advent of 4G/LTE, the growth rate of wireless data has far exceeded the capacity increase of mobile networks. A fundamentally new design paradigm is required to tackle the ever growing wireless data challenge. In this article, we investigate the problem of massive content delivery over wireless networks, and present a systematic view of content-centric network design and its underlying challenges. Toward this end, we first review some of the recent advancements in information-centric networking, which provide the basis of how media contents can be labeled, distributed, and placed across the networks. We then formulate the content delivery task into a content rate maximization problem over a shared wireless channel, which, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that attempts to increase the bit rate of a unicast system, maximizes the content delivery capability with a fixed amount of wireless resources. This conceptually simple change enables us to exploit the content diversity and network diversity by leveraging the abundant computation sources (through application-layer encoding, pushing and caching, etc.) within the existing wireless networks. A network architecture that enables wireless network crowdsourcing for content delivery is then described, followed by an exemplary campus wireless network that encompasses the above concepts.","1536-1284;15361284","","10.1109/MWC.2014.7000979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000979","","Bit rate;Encoding;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Multimedia communication;Wireless networks","cellular radio;optimisation;wireless channels","4G/LTE;content centric wireless delivery networks;information centric networking;maximization problem;media contents;mobile cellular networks;mobile connectivity;mobile data phenomenon;shared wireless channel;social media;wireless data;wireless resources","","5","","15","","","December 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SDN-oriented NOS design requires not only the control shift from the specific network functions and vendor-dependent implementation in a traditional control plane to a general control functions, but also the extension of abstraction from computing process in a computer operating system to forwarding operation. To address this, we present a novel network operating system-TUNOS from the view of device control capacities and network control capacities.

Univ., Singapore, Singapore","IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","","2015","15","2","181","190","Board-level drop reliability test and analysis require dynamic characterization of the high strain-rate properties of the solder, along with solder joint failure tests. Relying on just the drop impact analysis of board-level dynamic response (i.e. G-levels and board bending strains) and an oversimplification of deformation response of solder joints (i.e., assuming elastic stress criteria) can lead to misleading conclusions in the physics-of-failure understanding in drop impact tests. In this paper, impact tests were conducted with a split Hopkinson pressure bar test system to study the dynamic response of bulk solder materials. A finite-element analysis of drop impact was conducted by considering different solder constitutive models such as the elastic and strain rate-dependent plastic model to investigate the effect of the solder constitutive model on the dynamic response of the solder joint. The important finding of this study is that the constitutive model used has a major impact on the dynamic response of solder joint stress and strain results. Theoretically, it is predicted that the strain rate-dependent plastic model gave better correlation results than the simple elastic model. A solder joint reliability characterization using the drop impact test with a clamped-clamped boundary condition was investigated for a plastic ball grid array assembly with Sn-Ag-Cu solder and two board surface finishes. In order to assess drop reliability of solder joint with different surface finishes, Charpy test was conducted to evaluate the dynamic strength of the soldered specimen using Sn-Ag-Cu solder and with or without Ni/Au plating.","1530-4388;15304388","","10.1109/TDMR.2015.2408327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7053933","Board-level drop test;Charpy impact test;Sn-An-Cu solder joint;Sn???Ag???Cu solder joint;finite element modeling;finite-element modeling;strain rate-dependent model","Load modeling;Plastics;Reliability;Soldering;Strain;Stress","ball grid arrays;copper;dynamic response;failure analysis;finite element analysis;gold;nickel;reliability;silver;solders;tin","Charpy test;FEA;G-levels;Ni-Au;Sn-Ag-Cu;ball grid array assembly;board bending strains;board-level drop impact reliability;bulk solder materials;clamped-clamped boundary condition;drop impact analysis;dynamic response;elastic stress criteria;finite-element analysis;physics-of-failure;plating;solder constitutive model;solder constitutive models;solder joint failure tests;split Hopkinson pressure bar test system;strain rate-dependent plastic model;surface finishes","","0","","24","","20150303","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Different surface topographies were fabricated and then measured by an optical surface profiler and contact angle measurements. For bacterial adhesion experiments, an assay of Escherichia coli (E.coli) has been developed and used for bacterial adhesion measurements on both as received and the modified polystyrene surfaces. The method is based upon the staining of attached bacterial cells with the nucleic acid-binding, green fluorescent DAPI stain. The preliminary results show that laser-assisted modification by using laser ablation can make polystyrene substrates either more hydrophilic (with oxygen) or more hydrophobic (with air). The contact angle can be varied from 37° to 108°. The results on bacterial attachment show that the polystyrene substrates as received have no bacteria attached, indicating a good anti-bacterial performance. The treated substrates show some bacterial attachment and, in particular, the surfaces with high contact angle have much higher numbers of bacterial cells attached. This indicates that such laser-assisted process with air can make polystyrene surfaces more attractive to E. coli bacteria.","","","10.1109/3M-NANO.2013.6737421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737421","Surface topography;bacterial adhesion;contact angle;laser-assisted fabrication","Microorganisms;Rough surfaces;Substrates;Surface roughness;Surface topography;Surface treatment","adhesion;contact angle;hydrophilicity;hydrophobicity;polymers;surface roughness;ultraviolet radiation effects","Escherichia coli;UV-laser radiation;bacterial adhesion;contact angle;green fluorescent DAPI stain;hydrophilicity;hydrophobicity;nucleic acid-binding;optical surface profiler;polystyrene;surface roughness;surface topography","","1","","16","","","26-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Global ATM Security Management project (GAMMA) addresses the development of such a security situation management capability. Following the September 11 attacks and major large-scale outages of critical infrastructures, the security of air navigation has emerged as a critical capability gap. On-going transformation programs like SESAR and NextGen are moving into the deployment phase with limited to none tangible security solutions. GAMMA addresses this gap by investigating a security situation management capability. The framework of this capability is devised as a distributed network of aviation stakeholders that jointly collaborate in identifying and localizing security incidents while considering the constraints given by the different participants, national responsibilities, and collaboration-related requirements. This paper addresses the preparatory work for the validation of an initial security situation management capability. For that purpose, project partners setup a joint configuration and trial network for the security functions and systems developed in the frame of a real-time human-in-the-loop simulation. The simulation results have been measured against the mapping of the operational concept and validation requirements, in particular in terms of situational awareness on the operator side and networked incident management response.

The current literature reveals that the microgrid's control and management are designed to be tested either in a numerical simulation approach, or only under a specific hardware device/experiment environment; they do not deal with a comprehensive platform capable of easily executing very complex applications built by composing required functionalities in a standardized, easy-to-use, and well-defined way. To address the problem of limited testing functions of existing tools/platforms, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) approach, in particular combining a power-HIL (PHIL) and a signal-HIL (SHIL), is proposed in this paper. Such an approach is suitable for testing the system-level controller energy management systems (EMSs) and hardware controllers at signal level, as well as hardware devices like power converters at power level. Hence, this platform is designed for flexibility and universality. The HIL platform is presented in this work and its performance is demonstrated in a sample application.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2014.2349271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881724","Energy management system (EMS);hardware in-the-loop (HIL) simulation;microgrid","Control systems;Energy management;Microgrids;Real-time systems;Simulation;Voltage control","demand side management;distributed power generation;energy management systems;power convertors;power distribution control;power generation control","DER;EMS;complex applications;demand side management;distributed energy resources;energy management systems;hardware controllers;hardware in-the-loop testing;market operation;microgrid control;microgrid management;numerical simulation;power converters;universal platform;utility grid","","6","","45","","20140821","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Poor presentation quality and playback stalling have been identified as the most dominant factors that degrade user QoE. Although both factors have been studied individually, little is known about the interactions between them. In this work, we first construct a streaming video database that contains compressed videos at different distortion levels and with different stalling patterns. We then carry out a subjective test to evaluate the QoE of the videos. The results reveal some interesting dependency between presentation quality and playback stalling. Specifically, playback stalling always causes QoE degradation, but the strength of such degradation depends on the presentation quality when the stalling event occurs.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9961-6; POD:978-1-4673-9962-3","10.1109/ICIP.2016.7532790","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7532790","Presentation Quality;Quality-of-Experience;Video Stalling;Video Streaming","Bit rate;Databases;Distortion;Quality assessment;Streaming media;Video recording;Video sequences","","","","","","24","","","25-28 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the scalable and fault-tolerant nature of MapReduce introduces additional costs in disk IO and data transfer, caused by streaming intermediate outputs to disk. In light of these issues, many interesting research projects have been initiated with the goal of improving the compute speed and power efficiency of compute-intensive cloud computing workloads, several with the addition of discrete GPUs. In this work, we present a modified MapReduce approach focused on the iterative clustering algorithms in the Apache Mahout machine learning library that leverage the acceleration potential of the Intel integrated GPU in a multi-node cluster environment. The accelerated framework shows varying levels of speed-up (≈45x for Map tasks-only, ≈4.37x for the entire K-means clustering) as evaluated using the HiBench benchmark suite. Based on various experiments and in-depth analysis, we find that utilizing the integrated GPU via OpenCL offers significant performance and power efficiency gains over the original CPU based approach. Further analysis is also done to understand the correlations between compute, IO and power efficiency. As such, our results show that embracing the integrated GPU in the Hadoop MapReduce framework represents a promising advance in adding cost and energy efficient compute parallelism to a data parallel multinode environment.","","","10.1109/BigDataService.2015.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7184877","Big Data;GPGPU;Hadoop;Integrated Graphics;Machine Learning;Mahout;OpenCL","Acceleration;Graphics processing units;Java;Kernel;Optimization;Performance gain;Power demand","Big Data;graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;pattern clustering;power aware computing","Apache Hadoop;Apache Mahout machine learning library;Hadoop MapReduce framework;HiBench benchmark suite;Intel integrated GPU;MapReduce-based big data processing;OpenCL;acceleration potential;computational speed;data parallel multinode environment;data parallelism;data transfer;discrete GPU;disk IO;energy efficiency;energy efficient compute parallelism;fault-tolerant nature;iterative clustering algorithms;multinode cluster environment;power efficient MapReduce workload acceleration;programming models","","0","","33","","","March 30 2015-April 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fault diagnosis gains information from topology information and device parameters of primary system grid based on IEC61970 standard and device information of secondary system grid based on IEC 61850. Device information contains information of protection movement wave record and protection configuration. However, the existent CIM can't fully represent power system fault diagnosis information. Thus, it is need to extend CIM. All kinds of information are based on different model, which causes different information standard. In this paper a preliminary study on CIM extensions which is based on power system fault diagnosis, has been proposed to perfect fault information model. On the basis of different standard model, this paper has discussed the theory of coordinating IEC 61850 and IEC61970 standard, and proposed using Web Ontology Language (OWL) based on Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) to the solution of this problem. A fault Information Model is then provided to the fault diagnosis system according to Component Interface Specification (CIS) in IEC61970. After receiving fault information, the fault diagnosis system starts for real-time, on-line fault diagnosis. Fault information model has solved the problem of the deficiency and non-standard of fault diagnosis information, attaining fault diagnosis information integrity and standardization, and making the fault diagnosis result fast and accurate.","","","10.1109/DRPT.2011.5994013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5994013","CIM;CIS;Fault Diagnosis System;IEC 61850;IEC 61970;Information Model","Computer integrated manufacturing;Fault diagnosis;IEC standards;Object oriented modeling;Substations;Unified modeling language","IEC standards;XML;fault diagnosis;knowledge representation languages;power engineering computing;power grids;power system faults;power system simulation","CIM;IEC 61850 standard;IEC 61970 standard;OWL;Web ontology language;XML;common information model;device information;extensible mark up language;power grid fault diagnosis;power system fault diagnosis information;topology information","","1","","15","","","6-9 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, an artifact detection is an essential preprocessing step to allow a reliable fusion.

In order to relieve the effects of the co-channel interference perceived by mobile nodes, transmission channels are switched on a basis of a periodical Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) evaluation. The attention is focused on the routing level of VANET and we propose an interference aware routing scheme for multi-radio vehicular networks, wherein each node is equipped with a multi-channel radio interface. A new metric is also proposed, based on the maximization of the average SIR level of the connection between source and destination. Our solution has been integrated with the AODV routing protocol to design an enhanced Signal-to-Interference-Ratio-AODV (SIR-AODV). NS-2 has been used for implementing and testing the proposed idea, and significant performance enhancements were obtained, in terms of throughput, packet delivery and, obviously, interference.","1550-2252;15502252","","10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5956777","","Ad hoc networks;Interference;Measurement;Mobile communication;Routing;Routing protocols","channel allocation;radiofrequency interference;routing protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless LAN","IEEE802.11p standard;SIR-AODV;VANET;channel assignment scheme;interference-aware routing;mobile computing;mobile transmissions;multiradio vehicular networks;routing protocol;signal-to-interference ratio evaluation;vehicular internetworking environment;wireless communications","","8","","13","","","15-18 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Map-Reduce framework and its open-source implementation, Hadoop, is commonly used to program these applications. Since these applications scale well with an increased number of servers, the cluster size is an important parameter. Cluster size however is constrained by power consumption. In this paper we present a system that uses low-power CPUs to increase the cluster size in a fixed power budget. Using low-power CPUs leads to the situation where the majority of a server's power is now consumed by the I/O sub-system. To overcome this, we develop a virtualized I/O sub-system where multiple servers share I/O resources. An ASIC based high-bandwidth interconnect fabric, and FPGA based I/O cards implement this virtualized I/O. The resulting system is the first production quality implementation of cluster-in-a-box that uses low-power CPUs. The unique design demonstrates a way to build systems using low-power CPUs, allowing a much larger number of servers in a cluster in the same power envelope. To overcome software inefficiency and increase the utilization of virtualized disk bandwidth, optimizations necessary for the operating system are also discussed. We built hardware based on these ideas and experiments on this system show a 3X average improvement in performance-per-Watt-hour compared to a commodity cluster with the same power budget.","1530-0897;15300897","","10.1109/HPCA.2013.6522316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522316","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Fabrics;Hardware;Power demand;Servers;Virtualization","Internet;application specific integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;microprocessor chips;performance evaluation;power aware computing;public domain software","ASIC based high-bandwidth interconnect fabric;FPGA based I/O cards;MapReduce framework;Web-scale applications;cluster-in-a-box;commodity servers;distributed platform;hadoop;low-cost processing;low-power CPU;open-source implementation;performance-per-watt-hour;power consumption;scalable processing;virtualized I/O sub-system;virtualized disk bandwidth","","0","","30","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, deduplication at SSD device level distinguishes itself from the one at enterprise storage systems in many aspects, whose success lies in proper exploitation of underlying very limited hardware resources and workload characteristics of SSDs. In this paper, we develop a novel deduplication framework elaborately tailored for SSDs. We first mathematically develop an analytical model that enables us to calculate the minimum required duplication rate in order to achieve performance gain given deduplication overhead. Then, we explore a number of design choices for implementing deduplication components by hardware or software. As a result, we propose two acceleration techniques: sampling-based filtering and recency-based fingerprint management. The former selectively applies deduplication based upon sampling and the latter effectively exploits limited controller memory while maximizing the deduplication ratio. We prototype the proposed deduplication framework in three physical hardware platforms and investigate deduplication efficiency according to various CPU capabilities and hardware/software alternatives. Experimental results have shown that we achieve the duplication rate ranging from 4% to 51%, with an average of 17%, for the nine workloads considered in this work. The response time of a write request can be improved by up to 48% with an average of 15%, while the lifespan of SSDs is expected to increase up to 4.1 times with an average of 2.4 times.","2160-195X;2160195X","","10.1109/MSST.2012.6232379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6232379","","Acceleration;Educational institutions;Equations;Flash memory;Generators;Hardware;Software","NAND circuits;filtering theory;flash memories;storage management","CPU capability;NAND flash-based SSD;acceleration technique;cell lifetime;deduplication efficiency;deduplication framework;garbage collection overhead;hardware-software alternative;model analysis;quantitative analysis;recency-based fingerprint management;sampling-based filtering;workload characteristics;write performance","","10","1","","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most publishers depend on DRM to prevent regulation violations, thus hoping to nip piracy in the bud. The Potato System was one such system wherein the aim was to achieve better optimization in legally distributing music content.

"Hexrotor UAV platform enabling dextrous interaction with structures — Preliminary work","R. Voyles; G. Jiang","","Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR), 2012 IEEE International Symposium on","","2012","","","1","7","A force closure grasp is a term from dexterous manipulation that indicates a grasp that can resist any applied wrench, or force-torque. Force closure grasps are desirable because they can completely immobilize an object or impart an arbitrary wrench to an object. With fixed-base manipulators, determining the degree of force closure of a manipulation system is simplified to determining the degree of force closure of the gripper or end effector. In mobile manipulation, the manipulator base is not fixed to the ground so determining the set of wrenches that can be resisted is not strictly limited to the capabilities of the end effector. But due to the large differences in mass of the mobile base and end effector, it is generally safe to assume the degree of force closure is limited by the end effector and not by the ability of the mobile base to remain motionless. As aerial mobile manipulation has started to become an active area of research, the concept of force closure of the entire manipulation system needs to be considered. Conventional aerial platforms are not able to resist an arbitrary wrench so an end effector carried by such a vehicle will not be able to exhibit force closure. This is true because even current quad rotors lack both the number of degrees of freedom but also independence of the degrees of freedom due to the fact that the force vectors are all parallel. We have developed a hex-rotor system with six independent degrees of freedom providing force closure for a dexterous aerial vehicle for mobile manipulation tasks. The ability of the aerial mobile base to exert an arbitrary wrench coupled with a low degree of freedom manipulator will allow for an agile aerial mobile manipulator with true force closure.","","","10.1109/SSRR.2012.6523891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6523891","","","autonomous aerial vehicles;dexterous manipulators;end effectors;grippers;mobile robots;rotors","aerial mobile base;agile aerial mobile manipulator;arbitrary wrench;degree of force;degree of freedom;dexterous aerial vehicle;dextrous manipulation interaction;end effector;fixed base manipulator;force vector;gripper;hexrotor UAV;mobile base;mobile manipulation;quad rotor","","9","","34","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To quantitatively study how the tumor affects the partial oxygen pressure (PO2) distribution in a normal tissue, an improved Krogh's cylinder model that is more realistic than an assumption of homogeneous PO2 distribution in a certain region is used to describe the oxygen diffusion from a capillary into its surrounding tissue. In this study, a comparison of the oxygen transport in a normal tissue without tumors and with an implanted tumor is presented. The results show that when a tumor is implanted at the upstream part of a capillary, the entire surrounding normal tissue that is located at the downstream part of the capillary suffers from a low level of oxygen, and the PO2 in the normal tissue decreases by an average of 16%. In contrast, a tumor located at the downstream part of a capillary makes a slight impact on the PO2 distribution in the upstream normal tissue. However, in both situations, a part of the tumor mass that is far from the capillary is in the quiescent even necrotic status due to the lack of sufficient supply of oxygen.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/BHI.2012.6211594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211594","Cylinder Model;Diffusion;Oxygen Transport;Tumor Growth","Argon;Biological system modeling;Tumors","biodiffusion;cellular transport;tumours","Krogh cylinder model;PO2 distribution;capillary;implanted tumor;oxygen diffusion;oxygen transport;partial oxygen pressure distribution;quiescent even necrotic status;tumor mass;tumor part;tumor-induced effects;upstream normal tissue","","0","","13","","","5-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, existing research is founded on an unrealistic assumption; providers will share their private information including resource costs. Providers, as is well known, never actually do that to remain competitive. Technically, secure multiparty computation, which is a computational technique based on the cryptography, can be used to secure optimization, but it is too time-consuming. This paper presents a novel method to optimize virtual networks built over multiple domains, with great efficiency but without revealing any private information. Our method employs secure multi-party computation but only for masking sensitive values; it can optimize virtual networks under limited information without any time-consuming technique. It is solidly based on the theory of optimality, and is assured of finding reasonably optimal solutions. Experiments show that our method is fast and optimal in practice even concealing private information; it finds nearly optimal solutions in just a few minutes for large virtual networks with tens of nodes. This is the first work that can be implemented in practice for building optimal virtual networks across multiple domains.","1095-2055;10952055","","10.1109/ICCCN.2014.6911811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6911811","network optimization;network virtualization;secure multi-party computation","Algorithm design and analysis;Buildings;Indium phosphide;Optimization methods;Protocols;Virtualization","computer network security;cryptography;optimisation;virtual private networks","computational technique;cryptography;flexible network services;optimal virtual networks;private information;resource cost;secure multiparty computation;secure optimization;sensitive values;time-consuming technique;virtual network optimization","","2","","27","","","4-7 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Research questions: (1) What is the relationship between CMC anxiety and virtual team participation? (2) How does this relationship influence the perceptions of individual performance? (3) Does this relationship persist over time? Literature review: A literature review including communication and media structures, input-mediator-output team effectiveness, and individual CMC anxiety elements indicate researchable negative effects upon virtual team interaction and participation in CMC environments. Higher levels of individual CMC anxiety could dampen participation quantity, participation type (task versus social), participation quality, and perceptions of individual performance. Further, the initial negative interactions and behaviors could persist over time. Methodology: This quantitative quasiexperimental study involved surveying, observing, and coding the interactions of 22 virtual project teams (consisting of a total of 110 individuals) over a span of four months. The teams used a CMC tool with shared file space and discussion boards to coordinate database design and implementation work. Data were collected from questionnaire surveys, individual message postings, and team project scores. Individual message postings were coded to measure participation quality (task focus and topic introductions) and participation quantity (message count and words per message). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures multivariate analyses along with follow-up univariate statistical testing. Results and conclusions: The results indicate that individuals with higher levels of CMC anxiety participated less, sent fewer task-oriented messages, introduced fewer novel topics, and were rated more poorly by team members on their performance co- pared to individuals with lower levels of CMC anxiety. The results also show that CMC-anxious individuals do send relatively more social-oriented messages, perhaps to compensate for typical apprehensive communication behaviors in a virtual team environment. In addition, participation quality and quantity and perceptions of performance by CMC-anxious team members do not significantly improve, even with repeated interactions over CMC. Although study participants evidenced high engagement with the project tasks, the study is limited by its use of student subjects. The study suggests the importance of team leaders and role definitions for virtual teams, to counteract potential unintended effects of CMC technology use masking actual participation and contribution of virtual team members. Future research could investigate the efficacy of interventions for reducing the negative impacts of CMC anxiety in virtual team performance, as well as the influence of individual structures such as CMC anxiety in the use of CMC and team structures in the virtual team environment.","0361-1434;03611434","","10.1109/TPC.2016.2583318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552618","Anxiety;CMC anxiety;communication apprehension;computer-mediated communication;evaluation;longitudinal;media synchronicity theory (MST);performance;virtual teams","Atmospheric measurements;Computer mediated communication;Computers;Media;Organizations;Particle measurements;Virtual groups","computer mediated communication;statistical testing;virtual enterprises","CMC tool;apprehensive communication behaviors;communication structure;computer-mediated communication anxiety;file space sharing;individual message postings;individual performance perceptions;input-mediator-output team effectiveness;longitudinal effects;media structures;participation quality;participation type;repeated-measures multivariate analyses;social-oriented messages;survey questionnaire;team project scores;univariate statistical testing;virtual team interaction","","","","","","","Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because of this, the security of these algorithms such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman) depend on the difficulty to factorize the public keys. For many centuries, mathematicians have been fascinated by the subject of prime numbers, have studied their proprieties and have focused on developing several theories. Many primality tests, deterministic and probabilistic, were proposed to determine whether a number is prime or not. In this paper, we describe the implementation and performance of several primality tests, in order to determine which is more efficient: Fermat's test, Miller-Rabin test, Solovay-Strassen test, Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena (AKS) test, Lucas-Lehmer test, Baillie-PWS test, Pepin's test, Lucas-Lehmer-Riesel (LLR) test, Proth's theorem, Quadratic Frobenius test, Adleman-Pomerance-Rumley (APR) test, Lucas test or Pocklington test.

Each algorithm that is used for packet routing in such applications should be able to establish tradeoffs between end to end delay parameter and energy consumption. Therefore, enabling QoS applications in sensor networks requires energy and QoS awareness in different layers of the protocol stack. In this paper, we propose a Reliable and QoS Aware Multipath routing algorithm in wireless sensor networks namely RQMP. This protocol uses control message together with a Forward Error Correction (FEC) technique to establish a reliable connection between source and destination. RQMP maximizes the network lifetime via data transmission across multiple paths as load balancing that causes energy consume uniformly throughout the network. RQMP uses the residual energy, available buffer size, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and distance to sink to predict the best next hop through the paths construction phase. Also our proposed protocol employs a queuing model to handle both real time and non-real-time traffic. Simulation results show that our proposed protocol is more efficient than previous algorithms in providing QoS requirements and minimizing energy consumption.","","","10.1109/EIDWT.2012.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354731","","Delay;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Routing;Routing protocols","energy consumption;forward error correction;quality of service;queueing theory;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks","FEC technique;QoS aware multipath routing algorithm;RQMP;SNR;WSN;bandwidth constraints;delay constraints;energy consumption;forward error correction technique;nonreal-time traffic;protocol stack;quality of service;queuing model;reliable multipath routing algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","19-21 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accordingly, we propose a novel string-based prediction approach to fuse such events and to predict human affect in a continuous dimensional space.

For a thorough understanding of the obtained results, we provide additional benchmarks by more conventional feature-level modelling, and compare these and the string-based approach to fusion of signal-based features and string-based events. Our experimental results show that the proposed string-based approach is the best performing approach for automatic prediction of Valence and Expectation dimensions, and improves prediction performance for the other dimensions when combined with at least acoustic signal-based features.","","","10.1109/FG.2011.5771417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5771417","","Databases;Face;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Pixel;Speech;Visualization","audio databases;audio signal processing;audio-visual systems;behavioural sciences;feature extraction;video signal processing;visual databases","SEMAINE database;Valence dimension;behavioural event;continuous dimensional space;expectation dimension;facial point;feature level approach;feature level modelling;human to agent communication;signal based feature;spectral information;string based audiovisual fusion;string based event;string based prediction approach","","14","","35","","","21-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Release 8 of LTE has a number of gaps that prevent it from meeting the IMT-Advanced requirements for 4G. Release 10 has been proposed to fulfill the additional requirements. Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission and reception is the key technique in LTE-Advanced to improve the cell-edge throughput and/or system throughput, especially joint processing (JP) in CoMP provides multiple data transmission points among multiple cooperated cells for each user equipment (UE) in the network. The standard handover algorithm in LTE could not satisfy the concept of JP in LTE-Advanced. Therefore a new handover algorithm supports JP in LTE-Advanced is necessary. In this paper, a handover algorithm with JP in LTE-A system is implemented and simulated by a C/C++ simulation tool. Simulation results show that, when compared with the standard handover algorithm in LTE system, handover algorithm with JP in LTE-Advanced is able to improve system throughput and minimize packet loss ratio (PLR) effectively. However this algorithm could lead to system capacity overload and saturated system throughput issues when dealing large amount of UEs in the network.","","","10.1109/ECTICon.2012.6254240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6254240","3GPP LTE-Advanced;CoMP Transmission/Reception;Handover Algorithm;Joint Processing","Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Downlink;Joints;Simulation;Standards;Throughput","3G mobile communication;4G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;cooperative communication;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication computing","4G;C/C++ simulation tool;CoMP;IMT-Advanced requirements;LTE Release 10;LTE Release 8;LTE-A system;LTE-advanced;cell-edge throughput;cooperated cells;coordinated multipoint transmission-reception;data transmission points;handover algorithm;joint processing;packet loss ratio;packet-switched radio access technology;system capacity overload;system throughput;user equipment","","0","","10","","","16-18 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IAQC is an incremental and discrete-time version of the integral quadratic constraint (IQC) in the time domain. A constructive method of stabilising agents for use with decentralised model predictive controllers (MPC) in semi-automatic modes is subsequently introduced. Here, the nonzero set-point control and local disturbances are effectively dealt with by employing a quadratical dissipativity criterion w.r.t control inputs and plant outputs, and a norm bounded gain for the disturbance input and plant output pair. The procedure of IAQC-based stabilising agents accommodates the coexistence of feedback control and man-in-the-loop regulation. The multiplier matrices of the IAQC are updated on-the-fly to assure the constrained feasibility. The control application of a counter-current washing circuit in a hydrometallurgical process is simulated to illustrate the viability of the presented stabilising agent.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6114339","","Control systems;Integrated circuits;Interconnected systems;Large-scale systems;Silicon;Symmetric matrices;Vectors","decentralised control;feedback;interconnected systems;metallurgy;predictive control;stability;target tracking","IAQC-based stabilising agent;complex interconnected systems;constrained stabilisation;counter-current washing circuit;decentralised model predictive controller;feedback control;hydrometallurgical process;incrementally accumulative quadratic constraint;integral quadratic constraint;local disturbance;man-in-the-loop regulation;multiplier matrix;nonzero set-point control;semiautomatic control;set-point tracking","","5","","6","","","10-11 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So far the primary focus has been on how to incorporate the notion of budget into access control rather than what or if there is an optimal amount of budget to allocate to users.

However, there's not an agreement over what is the best method for doing it. It has been proposed that the Tonic Stretch Reflex Threshold might be a valid alternative as a quantitative measurement. In this context this paper presents the proposal of a computational tool that is meant to support the measurement of spasticity in stroke patients based on the Tonic Stretch Reflex Threshold method. Its purpose is to support therapy management by providing a quantitative measurement of the spasticity severity and to serve as a good tool to therapists, giving instructions and results in real time.

Such high blocking voltages and the correlating increased electrical field strengths induce partial discharges (PD) in the ceramic substrate as well in the encapsulating organic materials, which represent a key degradation mechanism of HV power modules. In this work a promising novel coating technology for ceramic substrate trenches, significantly enhancing the partial inception voltage (PDIV) of these substrates, is presented. The coating works as a refractive field control and reduces the field strengths in the most critical section for PD - the so-called triple point - between ceramic, encapsulate and copper metallization. Electric field simulations show a possible reduction of the electric loads in that critical area by over 10 %. Phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) tests confirm the simulation results by significantly increased partial discharge inception voltages (PDIV) of trench coated Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> DBC substrates (curamik® power) compared to untreated ones. Long term aging tests (1000 h @ 85 °C/85 % r. h.) on trench coated DBCs, covered with Wacker SilGel 612®, were executed to examine the robustness of this coating and to investigate the PD behavior of DBC substrates depending on the degree of aging.

"References","A. S. Chan","","Networking Peripheries:Technological Futures and the Myth of Digital Universalism","","2013","","","","","In Networking Peripheries, Anita Chan shows how digital cultures flourish beyond Silicon Valley and other celebrated centers of technological innovation and entrepreneurship. The evolving digital cultures in the Global South vividly demonstrate that there are more ways than one to imagine what digital practice and global connection could look like. To explore these alternative developments, Chan investigates the diverse initiatives being undertaken to ""network"" the nation in contemporary Peru, from attempts to promote the intellectual property of indigenous artisans to the national distribution of digital education technologies to open technology activism in rural and urban zones.Drawing on ethnographic accounts from government planners, regional free-software advocates, traditional artisans, rural educators, and others, Chan demonstrates how such developments unsettle dominant conceptions of information classes and innovations zones. Government efforts to turn rural artisans into a new creative class progress alongside technology activists' efforts to promote indigenous rights through information tactics; plans pressing for the state wide adoption of open source--based technologies advance while the One Laptop Per Child initiative aims to network rural classrooms by distributing laptops. As these cases show, the digital cultures and network politics emerging on the periphery do more than replicate the technological future imagined as universal from the center.","","97802623195","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6774206.pdf&bkn=6757879&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","2013","","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

Reducing the electrical contact resistance and the coefficient of friction are major technological requirements. This report provides electrical and tribological characteristics of a Copper containing Diamond-like Carbon (Cu-DLC) nanocomposite coating deposited on a brass plate, investigated with a ball-on-flat linear-reciprocating tribometer. The counterpart was a brass ball. While the initial electrical contact resistance was hundreds of milliohms, it gradually decreased with cycles and reached approximately 2 milliohms after 600 cycles. Coefficient of friction started below 0.35 and decreased progressively, stabilizing around 0.25 after 600 cycles. Sliding surfaces after different number of cycles were analyzed by optical microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and nanoindentation. The results of analyses revealed that a copper-rich tribofilm was built up on the ball and it grew and hardened as the sliding cycle increased. The Cu-DLC coating wore gradually and was almost worn out after less than 1000 cycles. However, detrimental effects were not observed either on electrical contact resistance or on coefficient of friction. Therefore, the tribofilm on the ball should have a key role in achieving and maintaining the good electrical-tribological characteristic.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857159","","","","","","0","","","","","22-26 June 2014","","VDE","VDE Conference Publications"

As a result, the experimentally observed degradation of the transconductance at low and medium current injection, which is a strong function of the Ge grading, as well as the output conductance are described by simple bias- and temperature-dependent formulations of the GICCR weight factors.

An important component needed for translation of MNPs is the detection and quantification of targeted MNPs bound to tumor cells. Method: This study explores the feasibility of a multi-frequency nonlinear magnetic spectroscopic method that uses excitation and pick-up coils and is capable of discriminating between quantities of bound and unbound MNPs in 0.5 ml samples of KB and Igrov human cancer cell lines. The method is tested over a range of five concentrations of MNPs from 0 to 80 μg /ml and five concentrations of cells from 50 to 400 thousand count per ml. Results: A linear model applied to the magnetic spectroscopy data was able to simultaneously measure bound and unbound MNPs with agreement between the model-fit and lab assay measurements (p<0.001). The detectable iron of the presented method to bound and unbound MNPs was < 2 μg in a 0.5 ml sample. The linear model parameters used to determine the quantities of bound and unbound nanoparticles in KB cells were also used to measure the bound and unbound MNP in the Igrov cell line and vice versa. Conclusion: Nonlinear spectroscopic measurement of magnetic nanoparticles may be a useful method for studying targeted MNPs in oncology.

Therefore we advocate distributing the modeling task among different teams, each working on a partial model. At the end, it is obviously necessary to merge models designed by different team members in order to obtain the global model. In this paper, we propose a signature-based approach to merge UML composite structures of software product lines. UML2 composite structures are good alternative for modeling SPLs.

In this paper, we focus on high-performance multi-label classification methods and their application for medical recommendations in the domain of 5G communication. In machine learning, multi-label classification involves assigning multiple target labels to each query instance. The vast number of labels poses a challenge for maintaining efficiency. Several related approaches have been proposed to meet this challenge.

We apply our proposed multi-label classification methods as an innovative 5G application to predict doctor labels for doctor recommendations. We perform experiments on real-world data sets.

This is achieved through a reformulation of these tunable thresholds, which avoids the constraints they must fulfill for the ordinal regression problem. During training, diversity exists in different projections generated by each member is taken into account for the parameter updating. This diversity is promoted in an explicit way using a diversity-encouraging error function, extending the well-known negative correlation learning framework to the area of ordinal regression, and inheriting many of its good properties.

Information describing precipitation and ground conditions at high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for taking timely action and preventing damages. Traditionally, rain gauges and weather radars are used to monitor rain events, but these sources provide low spatial resolutions and are subject to inaccuracy. Therefore, information needs to be complemented with data from other sources: from citizens' phone calls to the authorities, to relevant online media posts, which have the potential of providing timely and valuable information on weather conditions in the city. This information is often scattered through different, static, and not-publicly available databases. This makes it impossible to use it in an aggregate, standard way, and therefore hampers efficiency of emergency response. In this paper, we describe information sources relating to a heavy rain event in Rotterdam on October 12-14, 2013. Rotterdam weather monitoring infrastructure is composed of a number of rain gauges installed at different locations in the city, as well as a weather radar network. This sensing network is currently scarcely integrated and logged data are not easily accessible during an emergency. Therefore, we propose a reliable, efficient, and low-cost ICT infrastructure that takes information from all relevant sources, including sensors as well as social and user contributed information and integrates them into a unique, cloud-based interface. The proposed infrastructure will improve efficiency in emergency responses to extreme weather events and, ultimately, guarantee more safety to the urban population.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2014.2354980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892929","","Meteorological radar;Meterology;Sensor systems;Urban areas","","","","0","","38","","20140905","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this perspective, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been promoting research in the technological and educational areas, since they serve as an emerging and powerful knowledge-building platform for anyone, anytime and anywhere. However, limitations in the current development of MOOCs have required the search for strategies to support their personalization in order to enhance the users' learning and others skills, such as the ability to self-regulate and to work in a collaborative way, and not just to replicate the content already taught in the traditional classroom, through videos or other passive learning activities. Considering the need for changes in the MOOC's pedagogical model, this research aimed to investigate and promote a reflection about the possibility of using Flipped Classroom Teaching Model principles to design this type of virtual and massive environment. The paper starts with a description of MOOCs, Flipped Classroom and some related works used to support personalized learning in MOOCs. As a result of this investigation, we present some conceptual strategies for educators to design MOOCs from FC ideas and principles.

The main idea is to derive metamodels of the mean response and its dispersion depending only on control factors; thus, the optimization can tackle more effectively the tasks of bringing the mean response to within a set range and minimize the response statistical dispersion. The proposed method was used to optimize the sizing of the external circuitry of a low dropout voltage regulator used in automotive applications; several parameters were improved, especially w.r.t. reducing their dispersion with temperature by up to 28.5%. The method makes no assumptions on the uncontrollable factors and can work with a large variety of metamodels employed; also, it can be easily extended to multiple-response optimization.","","","10.1109/SIITME.2012.6384342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384342","Design of Experiments;Low-Dropout Voltage Regulator;Metamodelling;Robustness Optimization","Delay;Dispersion;Noise;Optimization;Robustness;Temperature;Voltage control","circuit optimisation;design of experiments;voltage regulators","application-oriented robustness optimization;automotive applications;control factors;design of experiments;external circuitry sizing;low dropout voltage regulator;metamodelling concepts;multiple-response optimization;power supply variations;response statistical dispersion","","3","","15","","","25-28 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The criteria can be summarized as three cases: the neighbor cell offers the same service as the serving cell; the neighbor cell offers lower service or better service than the serving cell. In the case of same service or lower service, both the absolute and the relative signal strength are used in cell reselection decision, but the reselection threshold is smaller in the case of lower service than in the case of same service. Further, in the case of better service, only the absolute signal strength is utilized in cell reselection decision, which means that the mobile should stay in a base station w ith better service if possible. Based on these analyses, a set of key parameters of cell reselection criteria is given by simulation, which is a trade-off between the number of cell reselections and the delay in cell reselection. And the proposed method can be adopted by network designers to optimize the behavior of cell reselection.","","","10.1049/cp.2011.0966","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6197833","absolute signal strength;cell reselection;hysteresis level;relative signal strength","","cellular radio;telecommunication services","cell reselection criteria;cell reselection decision;reselection threshold;signal strength model;terrestrial trunked radio;wireless trunking system","","0","","","","","27-30 Nov. 2011","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

With the increasing demands for product functionality, the pitch size and diameter of micro-bumps have become smaller, as a means of achieving higher input/output counts in microelectronic packages. However, by decreasing micro-bump diameter, integrity of the microelectronic package is becoming compromised. The majority of research on the system in package (SiP) has focused on the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) mismatch and heat junctions. The primary problems arising due to CTE mismatch and heat dissipation are failures or fatigues in 2.5D IC package, which can escalate to critical reliability issues. However, thermo-mechanical stress induced by temperature loading has a significant effect on material strength, causing, for example, interfacial cracking or micro-bump failure. Thus, 2.5D IC package modeling needs to be developed in order to identify factors that can mitigate micro-bump failure under reflow process.

Along this line, some recent studies revealed that the high-level concepts, such as word clusters, could help model the differences of data distributions, and thus are more appropriate for classification. In other words, these methods assume that all the data domains have the same set of shared concepts, which are used as the bridge for knowledge transfer. However, in addition to these shared concepts, each domain may have its own distinct concepts. In light of this, we systemically analyze the high-level concepts, and propose a general transfer learning framework based on nonnegative matrix trifactorization, which allows to explore both shared and distinct concepts among all the domains simultaneously. Since this model provides more flexibility in fitting the data, it can lead to better classification accuracy. Moreover, we propose to regularize the manifold structure in the target domains to improve the prediction performances. To solve the proposed optimization problem, we also develop an iterative algorithm and theoretically analyze its convergence properties. Finally, extensive experiments show that the proposed model can outperform the baseline methods with a significant margin. In particular, we show that our method works much better for the more challenging tasks when there are distinct concepts in the data.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2281451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606822","Common concept;distinct concept;distribution mismatch;nonnegative matrix trifactorization;triplex transfer learning","Accuracy;Companies;Data models;Iterative methods;Knowledge transfer;Manifolds;Optimization","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;optimisation;pattern classification;text analysis","data distributions;general transfer learning framework;iterative algorithm;knowledge transfer;nonnegative matrix trifactorization;optimization problem;text classification;triplex transfer learning","","4","","39","","20130923","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These needs were traditionally provided by clusters and supercomputers which are difficult to setup, manage or operate. While majority of the HPC installations ensure good resource utilization, the reach of these is restricted to few who are members of a specific HPC community. Cloud computing is emerging as a latest computing technology. The on-demand nature of cloud has provoked interest to explore if cloud properties can be useful for HPC setups. This paper is a work in that direction. The prevalent public clouds have accessibility to many and have been explored by the HPC community too. The biggest deterrent identified on these computing platforms for HPC workloads is the virtualization layer used by the cloud systems for resource provisioning. In this paper we propose a Platform-as-a-Service model to build an HPC cloud setup. The key goals for the architecture design is to include features like on-demand provisioning both for hardware as well as HPC runtime environment for the cloud user and at the same time ensure that the HPC applications do not suffer virtualization overheads. The architecture builds the required HPC platform by providing dedicated node or a group of nodes booted with the desired HPC environment without the virtualization layer. Technologies like Wake-on-LAN and network booting are used to achieve this goal. Once the usage of these resources is relinquished, the same nodes are re-deployed for another HPC platform. Thus this architecture merges cloud properties with HPC platforms for delivering effective performance. We show the results of benchmarks used to evaluate performance difference between a virtualized and non-virtualized environment for- this observation.","","","10.1109/CCBD.2015.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7450525","Cloud Computing;High Performance Computing;Platform-as-a-Service;Virtualization","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Runtime environment;Servers;Supercomputers;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;parallel processing;resource allocation;virtualisation","HPC applications;HPC cloud setup;HPC workload;Wake-on-LAN technology;cloud computing;cloud properties;high performance computing cloud;local area network;network booting technology;on-demand provisioning;platform-as-a-service perspective;resource provisioning;resource utilization;virtualization layer","","","","14","","","4-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bismuth telluride is considered as one of the candidates because of the good performance in room temperature. Besides, Sn-Bi solder paste has been employed to connect the electronic component and thermoelectric materials due to its low melting point. However, Te consumed rapidly because of the reaction between solder and bismuth telluride. The fast formation of intermetallic compound degraded the reliability of the joints. Thus, a Ni resistant layer plated by vacuum evaporation was introduced in current study to obstruct the formation of SnTe intermetallic compound and improve the mechanical stability and electrical properties of the joints. The results revealed that the resistance of p- or n-TE/SBA/Cu joints was stable and the shear strength of both them decreased during isothermal aging. There was no obvious SnTe intermetallic compound formed when introducing Ni layer. However, the p- or n-TE/Ni/SBA/Cu joints generated some defects such as cracks which grew larger during isothermal aging. With the increase of aging time, the resistance and shear strength increased and decreased, respectively. Besides, no obvious effect of introducing Ni layer between solder and thermoelectric materials on the mechanical property during aging process. It was suggested that the bonding strength of Ni layer may not strong enough through the vacuum evaporation method.","","","10.1109/ICEPT-HDP.2012.6474908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6474908","","Bonding;Compounds;Cooling;Heat recovery;Joints;Nickel","bismuth compounds;bonding processes;evaporation;mechanical stability;shear strength;solders;tellurium;thermal management (packaging);tin compounds","Ni;SnBi;SnTe;Te;aging process;bismuth telluride;bonding strength;electrical property;electronic component;electronic device;intermetallic compound;isothermal aging;joint reliability;mechanical property;mechanical stability;n-TE/Ni/SBA/Cu joints;nickel resistant layer plating;p-TE/Ni/SBA/Cu joints;sandwich structural;shear strength;solder paste;thermoelectric cooler;thermoelectric material;vacuum evaporation method","","1","","10","","","13-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of these radars operates over the frequency range of 2-8 GHz and is referred to as the “snow radar”. The other operates over the frequency range of 12-18 GHz and is called the “Ku-band radar” or “Ku-band altimeter”. Both radars use a Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FM-CW) transmit signal with about 150 mW of power. The radars have been operated on NASA long-range P-3 and DC-8 aircraft to collect data over snow-covered sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic, as well as over the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The results from recent data show that we can determine the thickness of snow from about 20 cm to 200 cm over sea ice and can map near surface internal layers to a depth of about 50 m in the dry snow zone with the snow radar. We are currently developing a radar that operates over the frequency range of 2-18 GHz and an antenna array to perform multi-polarized measurements. In this paper we will provide a brief overview of the current radars and present results from data collected with these radars over sea ice and the ice sheets.

Consequently, the inverters synchronize their voltage outputs and share the load power in proportion to their power ratings without any communication.

Lent","Mosaic ATM, Inc., Leesburg, VA, USA","Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS), 2012","","2012","","","H5-1","H5-13","In today's Traffic Flow Management (TFM) operation, some flow restrictions may be used that are procedurally applied to aircraft while they are on the ground before departure. Although there are some drawbacks to this approach, the application of required delay before flights depart allows that delay to be taken by the flight when it does not have to burn fuel to stay aloft. Delaying flights on the ground also allows the delay to be taken in a manner (i.e., parked on the ground) that does not create significant workload for the sector controllers. Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) that may cause flights to be held on the ground directly affect the airport surface operation. These TMIs must be explicitly considered in any airport surface decision support capability. In the case of Departure Queue Management, it is necessary to synchronize and coordinate the assigned take-off times for each flight with the airborne restrictions and requirements of these TMIs. In principle, this synchronization of the airport surface plan for a flight and the airborne requirements is the initial implementation of trajectory-based operations, including the synchronization of the surface and airborne portion of the trajectory. This paper describes the algorithms and methods by which the Collaborative Departure Queue Management (CDQM) concept for queue management accomplishes this integration and synchronization of the airport surface operational plan with the airborne and TFM plan.","2155-4943;21554943","","10.1109/ICNSurv.2012.6218409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218409","","Air traffic control;Aircraft;Airports;Collaboration;Delay;Logic gates;Synchronization","air traffic;airports;queueing theory;synchronisation;trajectory control","airborne requirements;airborne restrictions;airport surface decision;airport surface operation;airport surface plan;collaborative departure queue management;flight delay;sector controllers;synchronization;traffic flow management;traffic management initiatives;trajectory-based operations","","1","","6","","","24-26 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, it represents a more efficient and scalable approach to infer users' sensitive information without checking the content of Wi-Fi traffic. Secondly, meta-data based demographics inference can work on both unencrypted and encrypted traffic (e.g., HTTPS traffic). In this study, we present a novel approach to infer user demographic information by exploiting the meta-data of Wi-Fi traffic. We develop a proof-of-concept prototype, Demographic Information Predictor (DIP) system, and evaluate its performance on a real-world dataset, which includes the Wi-Fi access of 28,158 users in 5 months. DIP extracts four kinds of features from real-world Wi-Fi traffic and proposes a novel machine learning based inference technique to predict user demographics. Our analytical results show that, for unencrypted traffic, DIP can predict gender and education level of users with an accuracy of 78% and 74% respectively. It is surprising to show that, even for HTTPS traffic, user demographics can still be predicted at a precision of 67% and 72% respectively, which well demonstrates the practicality of the proposed privacy inference scheme.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9953-1; POD:978-1-4673-9954-8","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524528","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524528","","Cryptography;Electronics packaging;Feature extraction;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Privacy;Protocols","computer network security;cryptography;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","DIP system;HTTPS traffic;Wi-Fi network traffic analysis;Wi-Fi traffic;demographic information predictor;demographics inference;encrypted traffic;privacy inference;proof-of-concept prototype;sensitive information;unencrypted traffic;user privacy","","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Selecting warehouse location by means of the balancing and ranking method with an interval approach","B. Malmir; R. Moein; S. Kamal Chaharsooghi","Department of Industrial Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran","Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM), 2015 International Conference on","","2015","","","1","7","Selecting the proper warehouse location has been always one of the most important and strategic challenges in the optimization process of a logistics system. Such decisions have a great importance for companies because they are costly and difficult to reverse, and entail a long term commitment. Many quantitative and qualitative factors affect the selection of the warehouse location as a long term decision. A new balancing and ranking method combined with an interval data approach has been presented in this paper for solving a warehouse location selection problem. This method involves a three-step procedure to derive an overall complete final order of the warehouses which are already selected for the decision making. The procedure involves the definition of an outranking matrix based on the criteria values for all the available warehouse locations while taking into account the frequency of superiority of one location over others. The ordering of the warehouse locations has been performed based on the information of an advantages-disadvantages table, the distance travelled after final balancing, and the provisional order of locations. This is referred to as the triangularisation. It should be noted that unlike other MCDM models, the proposed method does not require weights for the decision making criteria. In addition, the proposed approach is much more flexible than the conventional methods in some other aspects. To demonstrate the procedural implementation of the proposed method and illustrate its effectiveness, it was applied to a case study and the results are evaluated and verified.","","","10.1109/IEOM.2015.7093911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7093911","balancing and ranking method;interval approach;multiple criteria decision making;outranking matrix;warehouse location selection","Decision making;Frequency modulation;Industrial engineering;Linear programming;Optical wavelength conversion;Software;Transportation","decision making;facility location;inventory management;matrix algebra;optimisation;warehousing","balancing-and-ranking method;criteria values;decision making;interval data approach;inventory management decisions;logistics system;optimization process;outranking matrix;triangularisation;warehouse location selection problem","","0","","28","","","3-5 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here the scope of the project work is to form a software tool that is able to convert the Graph based Data Warehouse representation to its equivalent Object - Oriented representation. Hence the tool helps the warehouse designer to interact with the graph without knowing anything about Object - Oriented representation and thus ease the entire complex design mechanism.

"Real-Time 3D Reconstruction in Dynamic Scenes Using Point-Based Fusion","M. Keller; D. Lefloch; M. Lambers; S. Izadi; T. Weyrich; A. Kolb","","2013 International Conference on 3D Vision - 3DV 2013","","2013","","","1","8","Real-time or online 3D reconstruction has wide applicability and receives further interest due to availability of consumer depth cameras. Typical approaches use a moving sensor to accumulate depth measurements into a single model which is continuously refined. Designing such systems is an intricate balance between reconstruction quality, speed, spatial scale, and scene assumptions. Existing online methods either trade scale to achieve higher quality reconstructions of small objects/scenes. Or handle larger scenes by trading real-time performance and/or quality, or by limiting the bounds of the active reconstruction. Additionally, many systems assume a static scene, and cannot robustly handle scene motion or reconstructions that evolve to reflect scene changes. We address these limitations with a new system for real-time dense reconstruction with equivalent quality to existing online methods, but with support for additional spatial scale and robustness in dynamic scenes. Our system is designed around a simple and flat point-Based representation, which directly works with the input acquired from range/depth sensors, without the overhead of converting between representations. The use of points enables speed and memory efficiency, directly leveraging the standard graphics pipeline for all central operations, i.e., camera pose estimation, data association, outlier removal, fusion of depth maps into a single denoised model, and detection and update of dynamic objects. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative results that highlight robust tracking and high quality reconstructions of a diverse set of scenes at varying scales.","1550-6185;15506185","","10.1109/3DV.2013.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599048","3D cameras and sensors;3D shape reconstruction;GPU;Kinect Fusion;Real-time","Cameras;Data models;Estimation;Iterative closest point algorithm;Robustness;Surface reconstruction;Three-dimensional displays","cameras;distance measurement;image fusion;image motion analysis;image reconstruction;natural scenes;object detection;object tracking;pose estimation;real-time systems","active reconstruction;camera pose estimation;consumer depth camera availability;data association;denoised model;depth map fusion;depth measurements;depth sensors;dynamic object detection;dynamic object update;dynamic scene reconstruction;memory efficiency;moving sensor;online 3D reconstruction;online method;outlier removal;point-based fusion;point-based representation;range sensors;real-time 3D reconstruction;real-time dense reconstruction;real-time performance;reconstruction quality;robust tracking;scene motion handling;standard graphics pipeline;static scene","","17","","27","","","June 29 2013-July 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, light-emitting diode (LED)-based optical communication has emerged as a promising approach to low-power, high-rate data transfer underwater over short-to-medium distances. However, LED-based communication relies on a close-to-line-of-sight link between the transmitter and the receiver, which presents significant challenges in its underwater robotic applications, where the underlying robots undergo constant motions due to propulsion and/or disturbances. In this paper we propose a novel and compact LED-based communication system with active alignment control, which maintains the communication link despite the underlying platform movement. Details on the system design and implementation are provided. The prototype is able to communicate at 115,200 bps over at least 23 m in swimming pool tests. Experiments involving a stationary transmitter and a mobile receiver mounted on a terrestrial robot are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the alignment maintenance system. In particular, it is shown that, for a communication distance of 3 m, the data loss under active alignment control is 9.9% at the transmission rate of 115,200 bps, when the robot orientation varies ±60°, while in comparison, the data loss is 56.2% in the absence of alignment control.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2065-2; POD:978-1-5090-2066-9; USB:978-1-5090-2064-5","10.1109/AIM.2016.7576760","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7576760","","Light emitting diodes;Optical fiber communication;Optical receivers;Optical transmitters;Robots;Voltage measurement","","","","","","","","","12-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to achieve a zero steady-state current control error in response to step commands, integral terms are incorporated into the current control scheme. Similarly, to ensure the rejection of the sinusoidal component of current control error caused by unbalance and distortion in the grid voltage, the oscillatory terms are added to the current control system. To calculate the current controller gains, an augmented plant model is developed and linear-quadratic optimization method is applied.

Under pairwise correlation and joint Gaussian assumption of received signals in frequency domain, an approximated form of the log-likelihood function is derived. Instead of a high complexity two-dimension grid-search on the likelihood function, a five-step method is employed for accurate estimations. Several variants are presented in the same framework with different complexities. Unlike conventional pilot-assisted schemes using the extra phase rotations within one OFDM block, the proposed technique turns to the phase rotations between adjacent OFDM blocks. Analytical expressions of the variances and biases are derived. Extensive simulation results indicate significant performance improvements over conventional schemes. Additionally, effects of several noise models including non-Gaussianity, cyclo-stationarity, and temporal correlation are analyzed and simulated. Robustness of the proposed technique against violation of the joint Gaussian assumption is also verified by simulations.","0090-6778;00906778","","10.1109/TCOMM.2013.021413.120112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466340","OFDM;baseband system;non-Gaussian noise;power-line communication;sampling clock offset;sampling phase offset","Covariance matrix;Estimation;Joints;OFDM;Signal to noise ratio;Timing","Gaussian noise;OFDM modulation;broadband networks;carrier transmission on power lines;frequency-domain analysis;log normal distribution;signal sampling","BB-PLC systems;OFDM block;SCO;SPO;baseband OFDM power-line communication;broadband power-line communication;conventional pilot-assisted schemes;conventional schemes;cyclo-stationarity;five-step method;frequency domain;joint Gaussian assumption;joint sampling timing acquisition;log-likelihood function;noise models;nonGaussian noise;nonGaussianity;orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing OFDM;pairwise correlation;performance improvements;phase rotations;received signals;robustness;sampling clock offset;sampling phase offsetgauss;temporal correlation;two-dimension grid-search","","6","","40","","20130220","April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nevertheless, Q&A services are detached from the development environments used by programmers: Developers have to tap into this crowd knowledge through web browsers and cannot smoothly integrate it into their workflow. This situation hinders part of the benefits of Q&A services. To better leverage the crowd knowledge of Q&A services, we created Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin that supports an integrated and largely automated approach to assist programmers using Stack Overflow. Seahawk formulates queries automatically from the active context in the IDE, presents a ranked and interactive list of results, lets users import code samples in discussions through drag & drop and link Stack Overflow discussions and source code persistently as a support for team work.

While this may be sufficient is some domains, we argue against this approach, particularly where the complexity of the models and the variety of user preferences pose greater challenges to the metaheuristic search algorithms. We build on our previous investigation which uncovered the power of Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA) over traditionally-used algorithms (such as NSGA-II), and in this work we scrutinize the time behavior of user objectives subject to optimization. This analysis brings out the business perspective, previously veiled under Pareto-collective gauges such as Hypervolume and Spread.

In this paper we will present the new generation of gamma camera, called GAMPIX. This system is based on the Timepix chip, hybridized with a CdTe substrate. A coded mask could be used in order to increase the sensitivity of the camera. Moreover, due to the USB connection with a standard computer, this gamma camera is immediately operational and user-friendly. The final system is a very compact gamma camera (global weight is less than 1 kg without any shielding) which could be used as a handheld device for radioprotection purposes.

In this work, we present a closed-form analytical solution to the steady-state heat equation applicable to compound semiconductor high electronic mobility transistors (HEMTs), such as those based on gallium nitride (GaN). While numerical techniques are widely used to predict device temperature, our analytical solution is more computationally-efficient and can account for complex multi-layer structures, internal heat sources, and a variety of thermal interface conditions. Through a Fourier series-based solution and recursive relations for the Fourier coefficients in adjacent layers, we report manageable expressions for the Fourier coefficients. We also demonstrate that these solutions are two orders of magnitude more efficient than state of the art semi-analytical techniques for complex 3D structures.

However, DSR and other on-demand routing protocols are vulnerable to different types of security attacks and black hole attack is one of them. In black hole attack, malicious node sends a fake route reply in response of route request to source node claiming for an optimal route to the destination. Thus, node which starts route discovery process establishes a path through malicious node and starts sending data packet on this route. Malicious node drops the data packet which reduces packet delivery ratio. To secure DSR, we propose a scheme which confirms the authenticity of route with the help of verification packet.

The system performance is compared against Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and external stereo vision measurements as ground truth.

Java Card is a reduced set of the Java standard designed for these systems. In a context of scarce resources such as smart cards, ROM size plays a very important role and dictionary compression techniques help in reducing program sizes as much as possible. At the same time, to overcome the intrinsic slow execution performance of a system based on interpretation it is possible to enhance the interpreter speed by means of specific hardware support. In this paper we apply the dictionary compression technique to a Java interpreter built on an application specific processor. Moreover, we move part of the decompression functionalities in hardware with the aim of speeding up the execution of a compressed application. We obtain a new interpreter that executes compressed code faster than a classic interpreter that executes non-compressed code.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7483777","Compression;Hardware-supported Interpreter;Java Card;Smart Card","Dictionaries;Hardware;Java;Random access memory;Smart cards;Standards;Virtual machining","","","","","","12","","","11-13 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, to use force sensors in all the required cases makes the system not only expensive but also bulky. Force-sensor-less power-assist control (FSPAC) which uses only encoders to obtain the external force information and provides force control performance can address this problem. Due to its simplicity and wide application, FSPAC is an essential technology to control a motor in a human-friendly way, but the design of FSPAC is different from the conventional feedback controllers so a new design methodology needs to be established. In order to attack this problem, this paper generalizes and analyzes the structure and characteristics of FSPAC. The generalized structure reveals how FSPAC can achieve the assistance, and the transfer function analysis based on the structure addresses the robustness and assistance performance evaluation problems. The robustness of FSPAC is analyzed in terms of the gain margin and robust stability, and the limitation of the power assistance to guarantee the robust stability is derived. Then, the evaluation way of feedback control design in FSPAC is provided.

Traditionally, ANSPs have operated all their communication in a relatively closed network environment. Air Traffic control data communications between the controller and the pilot; using existing Communication Service Provider (CSP) infrastructure over the existing data radio exposes the air traffic control message traffic to vulnerabilities in the network outside the ANSP domain. The use of shared radio and the ground infrastructure necessitates operation in a relatively open network environment where the ANSP network is interconnected with the CSP network which in turn is connected to airlines operations. Network hackers can probe for vulnerabilities in the network and launch a covert network attack at an appropriate time. While the air to ground communication security is subjected to collaborative standards evolution, there is a need to address the potential of distributed network attacks that may be launched from outside on the ground network. This paper explores potential vulnerabilities in the ground network, possible techniques to mitigate attacks, such as distributed denial of service attacks launched by hackers on the ground infrastructure outside the ANSP domain.

However, detecting small lipid pools in vivo requires accurate and robust displacement estimation over a wide range of displacement magnitudes. Phase-shift estimators such as Loupas' estimator and time-shift estimators such as normalized cross-correlation (NXcorr) are commonly used to track tissue displacements. However, Loupas' estimator is limited by phase-wrapping and NXcorr performs poorly when the SNR is low. In this paper, we present an adaptive displacement estimation algorithm that combines both Loupas' estimator and NXcorr. We evaluated this algorithm using computer simulations and an ex vivo human tissue sample. Using 1-D simulation studies, we showed that when the displacement magnitude induced by thermal strain was >λ/8 and the electronic system SNR was >25.5 dB, the NXcorr displacement estimate was less biased than the estimate found using Loupas' estimator. On the other hand, when the displacement magnitude was ≤λ/4 and the electronic system SNR was ≤25.5 dB, Loupas' estimator had less variance than NXcorr. We used these findings to design an adaptive displacement estimation algorithm. Computer simulations of TSI showed that the adaptive displacement estimator was less biased than either Loupas' estimator or NXcorr. Strain reconstructed from the adaptive displacement estimates improved the strain SNR by 43.7 to 350% and the spatial accuracy by 1.2 to 23.0% (P <; 0.001). An ex vivo human tissue study provided results that were comparable to computer simulations. The results of this study showed that a novel displacement estimation algorithm, which combines two different displacement estimators, yielded improved displacement estimation and resulted in improved strain reconstruction.","0885-3010;08853010","","10.1109/TUFFC.2014.006516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7002933","","Educational institutions;Estimation;Heating;Imaging;Lipidomics;Strain;Ultrasonic imaging","adaptive estimation;biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;image reconstruction;lipid bilayers;medical image processing;ultrasonic imaging","1D simulation;Loupas' estimator;adaptive displacement estimation algorithm;atherosclerotic arteries;lipid;normalized cross correlation;phase-shift estimators;thermal strain imaging reconstruction;time-shift estimators;water based tissues","","1","","47","","","January 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This group of factors can be defined as the pupils' attitude. Because, in the final line, the whole effort i.e. introduction of ICT in Visual Arts education is primarily done for pupils, their opinions, motivations and expectations should also be researched and evaluated.

Especially in the area of high performance computing (HPC), elasticity can be used to execute irregular and CPU-intensive applications. However, the on- the-fly increase/decrease in resources is more widespread in Web systems, which have their own IaaS-level load balancer. Considering the HPC area, current approaches usually focus on batch jobs or assumptions such as previous knowledge of application phases, source code rewriting or the stop-reconfigure-and-go approach for elasticity. In this context, this article presents AutoElastic, a PaaS-level elasticity model for HPC in the cloud. Its differential approach consists of providing elasticity for high performance applications without user intervention or source code modification. The scientific contributions of AutoElastic are twofold: (i) an Aging-based approach to resource allocation and deallocation actions to avoid unnecessary virtual machine (VM) reconfigurations (thrashing) and (ii) asynchronism in creating and terminating VMs in such a way that the application does not need to wait for completing these procedures. The prototype evaluation using OpenNebula middleware showed performance gains of up to 26 percent in the execution time of an application with the AutoElastic manager. Moreover, we obtained low intrusiveness for AutoElastic when reconfigurations do not occur.","2168-7161;21687161","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2424876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090978","Cloud elasticity;asynchronism;high-performance computing;resource management;self-organizing","Cloud computing;Elasticity;Graphical user interfaces;Measurement;Monitoring;Resource management","cloud computing;middleware;parallel processing;resource allocation;source code (software);virtual machines","AutoElastic manager;AutoElasticity;CPU-intensive applications;HPC;IaaS-level load balancer;OpenNebula middleware;PaaS-level elasticity model;Web systems;aging-based approach;automatic resource elasticity;cloud applications;cloud computing;high performance applications;high performance computing;resource deallocation;source code modification;source code rewriting;stop-reconfigure-and-go approach;virtual machine reconfigurations","","2","","46","","20150421","Jan.-March 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is a rather new research and BCI application area. Control of applications can be made more robust by fusing brain activity information with other information, either explicitly provided by a user (such as commands) or extracted from the user by interpreting his or her behavior (movements, posture, gaze, facial expression, nonverbal speech) or sensing (neuro-)physiological characteristics (skin conductivity, heart rate, brain activity). We see also research where brain activity of multiple users is fused to get a (sometimes critical) control task done. We see also the emergence of applications where BCI measurements help to improve group performance, for example, during meetings, or where information obtained from these measurements helps to learn about audience preferences. Multi-brain BCI has also become a paradigm in artistic and game applications. Artistic interactive BCI applications may require audience participation. In game environments brain activity of various players can be used to control or adapt the game.

In this study, we propose a new stimuli-driven, non-volitional brain responses based framework towards individual identification. The non-volitional mechanism provides an even more secure way in which the subjects are not aware of and thus can not manipulate their brain activities. We present our preliminary investigations based on two pattern matching approaches: Euclidean Distance (ED) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We investigate the performance of our proposed methods using four different visual stimuli and the potential impacts from four different EEG electrode channels. Experimental results show that, the Oz channel provides the best identification accuracy for both ED and DTW methods, and the stimuli of illegal strings and words seem to trigger more distinguishable brain responses. For ED method, the accuracy of identifying 30 subjects could reach over 80%, which is better than the best accuracy of about 68% that can be achieved by DTW method.

The strong interference in the downlink from the femtocells should be well controlled to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirement of both macrocell users and femtocell users. We provide both centralized and distributed schemes to solve the formulated optimization problem, which is aimed at minimizing the total power consumption as well as guaranteeing the QoS of both macrocell and femtocell users.

The distributed scheme is easily operated by individual femtocell with some coordination information delivered by nearby macrocells indicating the downlink interference power level.

Firstly, using the Kinect camera (Webcam) and image processing techniques, it is possible to detect a human face, allowing the robot to track the face, getting closer of a person, moving forward and rotating to get a better position to interact with him/her. Besides that, it is possible to recognize hand gestures using the Kinect 3D sensor, when correctly positioned related to the person. The proposed gesture recognition method tracks the hands positions and movements, when moving it forward towards the robot, and then recognizing a set of predefined gestures/commands. Finally, the 3D perception provided by the Kinect also allows us to detect obstacles, avoiding collisions and helping to move safely and to search for someone in the environment. Practical experiments are presented demonstrating the obtained results in the searching, tracking of faces and obot positioning related to the user, and also, in the gesture recognition.","","","10.1109/SBR.LARS.Robocontrol.2014.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7024282","face tracking;human gesture;kinect sensor;perception;robotics;telepresence","Collision avoidance;Face;Gesture recognition;Mobile robots;Navigation;Robot sensing systems","collision avoidance;face recognition;gesture recognition;image motion analysis;mobile robots;object tracking;robot vision;telerobotics","3D perception;Kinect 3D sensor;Kinect camera;Kinect sensor;Webcam;collision avoidance;gesture recognition method;hand gesture recognition;human face detection;human gesture interface;image processing technique;image-based face tracking;obstacle detection;perception/interface device;telepresence mobile robot;telepresence robot","","1","","20","","","18-23 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Automatically Bridging UML Profiles to MOF Metamodels","I. Malavolta; H. Muccini; M. Sebastiani","Gran Sasso Sci.

The choice of the right approach depends on several aspects, such as tool support, expressivity, complexity of models, company policies. In general, profiled UML models are very much used since they are intuitive for designers and model editors already exist, however they are intrinsically complex for model manipulation (e.g., Transformation, analysis), conversely, domain specific models are more concise and easy to be manipulated, but they require an initial effort in terms of designers training and model editors development. In this paper we propose an approach that allows getting the best of the two worlds: on one side designers can use UML profiles familiar to them, on the other side DSML models (automatically generated from profiled UML models) enable a better model manipulation. Our approach is based on an automatic bridge between UML profiles and MOF metamodels (which are the main artifacts of MOF-based DSMLs). The bridge is transparent to the user since it autonomously operates both on UML profiles and all the involved models. The bridge is realized through model transformation techniques in the Eclipse platform. In this paper we show its application on a case study based on SysML.","1089-6503;10896503","","10.1109/SEAA.2015.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7302461","Model-driven engineering;UML;metamodeling;model transformation","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Bridges;Complexity theory;Metamodeling;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;software tools","DSMLs;Eclipse platform;MOF metamodels;MOF-based domain specific modeling languages;SysML;UML profiles;automatic bridge;company policies;designers training;domain specific applications;domain specific models;model complexity;model editors development;model manipulation;model transformation techniques;model-driven engineering;tool support","","","","19","","","26-28 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We strongly advocate the use of relative pose information stored in a topological map, rather than a globally consistent metric representation of the environment. We show how multiple traversals of adjacent workspaces can be naturally “stitched” together in the course of a typical warehouse picking and shelving schedule to create a network of reusable paths in which the robot can efficiently localise and plan new routes. This allows us to command the robot to return to any of the previously visited locations not necessarily through the same route that we taught it. Unlike state-of-the-art teach and repeat systems using stereo vision, our approach exploits the strongly planar nature of the data obtained from a downward-facing camera, and creates odometric constraints by tracking the perceived texture of the floor and computing a simple homography. To demonstrate the robustness of our system, we validate our approach on datasets collected over a week-long period within a challenging and representative environment in the form of a warehouse shelving area.","1050-4729;10504729","","10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139650","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139650","","Cameras;Navigation;Robot kinematics;Robot vision systems;Robustness","graph theory;industrial robots;warehousing","datasets;downward-facing camera;homography;infrastructure-free warehouse navigation;monocular cameras;odometric constraints;relative pose information;shelving schedule;topological map;universally applicable graph-based framework;warehouse picking;warehouse robots","","0","","24","","","26-30 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The adjustment of a predictive model is controlled by the hyperparameter settings of a selected algorithm. Although the problem of hyperparameter optimization has been studied for decades in various disciplines, the adaptiveness of the initially selected model is not as well understood. This paper presents an approach to continuously re-select hyperparameter settings of the algorithm in a large-scale retail recommender system. In particular, an automatic hyperparameter optimization technique is applied on collaborative filtering algorithms in order to improve prediction accuracy. Experiments have been conducted on a large-scale real retail dataset to challenge traditional assumption that a one-off initial hyperparameter optimization is sufficient. The proposed approach has been compared with a baseline approach and a widely used approach with two scalable collaborative filtering algorithms. The evaluations of our experiments are based on a 2-year real purchase transaction dataset of a large retail chain business, both its online e-commerce site and its offline retail stores. It is demonstrated that continuous hyperparameter optimization can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of a recommender system.

On the one hand, for the macro-network, the scheme is intended to ensure the macrocell users can endure much more interference from the femtocell users. On the other hand, with respect to the femto-networks, the scheme can effectively improve the received signal strength relative to cross-tier macrocell interference of the femtocell users. As a result, the femtocell users can obtain a relative improvement in their Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR). Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the existing works, the proposed scheme can not only increase the number of the successful femtocell users, but also improve the average SINR of the femtocell users.","1347-6890;13476890","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6618527","","Educational institutions","cognitive radio;femtocellular radio;interference suppression;quality of service","CRRS;SINR;cognitive radio relay selection scheme;cross-tier interference mitigation;cross-tier macrocell interference;femtocell two-tier heterogeneous networks;received signal strength relative;signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio","","0","","11","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although formation of these intrinsic defects is likely influenced by CdTe deposition parameters, it also may be coupled to formation of beneficial cadmium vacancy (V<sub>Cd</sub>) defects. If this is true, reducing potential effects of V<sub>Te</sub> or Te<sub>i</sub> may be difficult without also reducing the density of V<sub>Cd</sub>. In contrast, post-deposition processes can sometimes afford a greater degree of defect control. Here we explore a post-deposition process that appears to influence the Te-related defects in polycrystalline CdTe. Specifically, we have exposed the CdTe surface to Te prior to ZnTe:Cu/Ti contact-interface formation with the goal of reducing V<sub>Te</sub> but without significantly reducing V<sub>Cd</sub>. Initial results show that when this modified contact is used on a CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated CdS/CdTe device, significantly poorer device performance results. This suggests two things: First, the amount of free-Te available during contact formation (either from chemical etching or CuTe or ZnTe deposition) may be a more important parameter to device performance than previously appreciated. Second, if processes have been used to reduce the effect of V<sub>Te</sub> (e.g., oxygen and chlorine additions to the CdTe), adding even a small amount of Te may produce detrimental defects.","0160-8371;01608371","","10.1109/PVSC.2012.6318261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6318261","CdTe;Contacts;Defects;Stoichiometry;ZnTe","Charge carrier lifetime;Glass;Junctions;Performance evaluation;Radiative recombination;Surface treatment;Vacuum systems","II-VI semiconductors;cadmium compounds;solar cells;thin film devices","CdS-CdTe;Te-interstitial defects;Te-vacancy defects;back contact exposure;beneficial cadmium vacancy defects;contact formation;contact-interface formation;defect control;deposition parameters;intrinsic defects;post-deposition processes;thin-film PV devices;thin-film photovoltaic devices","","1","","7","","","3-8 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Assist-as-needed path control for the PASCAL rehabilitation robot","U. Keller; G. Rauter; R. Riener","Sensory-Motor Syst. Lab., ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR), 2013 IEEE International Conference on","","2013","","","1","7","Adults and children with neurological disorders often require rehabilitation therapy to improve their arm motor functions. Complementary to conventional therapy, robotic therapy can be applied. Such robots should support arm movements while assisting only as much as needed to ensure an active participation of the patient. Different control strategies are known to provide arm support to the patient. The path controller is a strategy that helps the patient's arm to stay close to a given path while allowing for temporal and spatial freedom. In this paper, an assist-as-needed path controller is presented that is implemented in the end-effector-based robot PASCAL, which was designed for children with cerebral palsy. The new control approach is a combination of an existing path controller with additional speed restrictions to support, when the arm speed is too slow, and to resist, when the speed is too fast. Furthermore, a target position gain scheduling is introduced in order to reach a target position with a predefined precision as well as an adaptable direction-dependent supportive flux that supports along the path. These path control features were preliminarily tested with a healthy adult volunteer in different conditions. The presented controller covers the range from a completely passive user, who needs full support to an actively performed movement that needs no assistance. In close future, the controller is planned to be used to enable reaching in children as well as in adults and help to increase the intensity of the rehabilitation therapy by assisting the hand movement and by provoking an active participation.","1945-7898;19457898","","10.1109/ICORR.2013.6650475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650475","","End effectors;Force;Impedance;Pediatrics;Trajectory","end effectors;medical robotics;path planning;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;velocity control","PASCAL rehabilitation robot;active participation;adaptable direction-dependent supportive flux;arm motor functions;arm speed;assist-as-needed path control;children with cerebral palsy;control approach;end-effector-based robot;hand movement;neurological disorders;rehabilitation therapy;robotic therapy;speed restrictions;target position gain scheduling","","4","","20","","","24-26 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to high computational cost, it is generally not convenient for use in large scale datasets. This paper proposes three strategies for improving the time efficiency of the algorithm when applied on large datasets. The first strategy uses grid based sampling methods to first reduce the dataset size by approximately ten times and then uses a novel parameter initialization method to initialize parameters that are close to their final values. The second strategy is an adaptive approach that uses past errors to make the algorithm converge faster i.e. by taking lesser number of iterations. The third strategy introduces a way of performing parallel computations in EM algorithm that is different from earlier approaches, such that computation is distributed amongst parallel threads and simultaneously have minimum communication load. Extensive experimentation on 2 dimensional synthetic datasets that were generated with multiple Gaussian distribution components, have revealed that the proposed strategies are able to reduce the processing time by upto ten times, with first and third strategies performing especially well.","","","10.1109/WCI.2015.7495515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7495515","Expectation Maximization;Gaussian Mixture Models;fast;grid;large scale data;sampling","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Convergence;Covariance matrices;Gaussian mixture model;Parallel processing;Signal processing algorithms","Gaussian processes;data mining;expectation-maximisation algorithm;mixture models;sampling methods","EM algorithm;Gaussian mixture model;expectation maximization algorithm;grid based sampling;iterative algorithm;large scale data;parameter initialization method","","","","16","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a model where vehicles communicate beforehand with the grid to convey information about their charging status, and develop a mathematical model of handling requests for charging vehicles at public charging station based on queuing theory.

For accurate temperature consideration, two experimental estimation approaches are proposed. One uses the temperature measured at end windings to represent the internal temperature of the machine. The other uses both the measured temperature and other temperature information obtained from a temperature distribution analysis.

In particular, novel assistive technologies are being developed to make accessible street navigation to impaired people. The solution that we propose in this new application domain of intelligent transportation systems is a framework for a safe point-to-point navigation, owing to high-detailed road graphs, including sidewalks, crosswalks, and generic “obstacles.” The system is based on a low-cost modular sensor box (embedded hardware) interfaced with a mobile/phone application that acts as an intelligent navigator. The main novelty is the capability to sense the surrounding area while being able to perform a fast path replanning, owing to a real-time link to a remote server, if an obstacle is detected. The sensing is performed using different sensors, such as ultrasound, lidar, and a 77-GHz mid-range automotive radar (absolutely novel in the AAL context), which are processed and fused in the well-established robot operating system (ROS). We tested the framework by analyzing its performance in two different configurations and environments by using, respectively, a sonar and a laser rangefinder in a building scenario and a radar in an urban environment. Even if in both cases results demonstrated a quite good robustness in the obstacle detection with a quasi-real-time route replanning, we were mainly interested and succeeded in demonstrating the high flexibility and extensibility of our framework.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2489261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314916","AAL;ITS;ROS;embedded systems;impaired people;point to point navigation;radar;route planning;sensor box","Ambient assisted living;Embedded systems;Mobile communication;Multisensor systems;Navigation;Radar;Robot sensing systems","ambient intelligence;assisted living;graph theory;handicapped aids;intelligent sensors;intelligent transportation systems;laser ranging;mobile computing;navigation;object detection;optical radar;road vehicle radar;sensor fusion;sonar;ultrasonic transducers","AAL;accessible street navigation;ambient assisted living;assistive technologies;building scenario;crosswalk;embedded hardware;embedded multisensor system;fast path replanning;frequency 77 GHz;generic obstacles;high-detailed road graph;impaired people;impaired users;intelligent navigator;intelligent transportation systems;laser rangefinder;lidar sensor;low-cost modular sensor box;midrange automotive radar;mobile phone application;obstacle detection;quality of life improveent;quasireal-time route replanning;safe point-to-point navigation;sidewalk;smart objects;sonar;ultrasound sensor;urban environment","","","","54","","20151102","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Well-structured information about the composition of power systems is increasingly becoming available in the domain, e.g. due to standard information models (e.g. CIM or IEC61850) or otherwise structured databases. More measurements and data do not automatically improve decisions, but there is an opportunity to capitalize on this information for decision support. With suitable reasoning strategies data can be contextualized and decision-relevant events can be promoted and identified. This paper presents an approach to link available structured power system data directly to a functional representation suitable for diagnostic reasoning.

Autonomy is acquired by learning sensorimotor patterns of a robot, while it is interacting with its environment. Gaussian processes (GP) with automatic relevance determination are used to learn the sensorimotor mapping. In this way, relevant sensory and motor components can be systematically found in high-dimensional sensory and motor spaces. We propose an incremental GP learning strategy, which discerns between situations, when an update or an adaptation must be implemented. The Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT*) algorithm is exploited to enable long-term planning and generating a sequence of states that lead to a given goal; while a gradient-based search finds the optimum action to steer to a neighbouring state in a single time step. Our experimental results prove the suitability of the proposed framework to learn a joint space controller with high data dimensions (10×15).

The system under consideration is subject to sector-bounded nonlinearity, unknown but bounded noises and sensor saturations. Each intelligent sensing node transmits the data to its neighbors only when certain triggering condition is violated. By means of a set of recursive matrix inequalities, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the desired distributed event-based filter which is capable of confining the system state in certain ellipsoidal regions centered at the estimates. Within the established theoretical framework, two additional optimization problems are formulated: one is to seek the minimal ellipsoids (in the sense of matrix trace) for the best filtering performance, and the other is to maximize the triggering threshold so as to reduce the triggering frequency with satisfactory filtering performance. A numerically attractive chaos algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problems. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2016.2582081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505990","Distributed set-membership filtering;event-based filtering;nonlinear time-varying systems;sensor networks;sensor saturations;unknown but bounded noise","Ellipsoids;Network topology;Nonlinear systems;Optimization;Sensors;Time-varying systems;Topology","","","","","","","","20160707","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Both P300 potentials and sensory-motor rhythms are directly exploited and discussed. Classification results showed that even under very demanding conditions, which was, 200ms inter-stimulus interval of the P300 stimuli and actual/imaginary finger press once per 1.6s, the paradigm can evoke both P300 potentials and sensory-motor rhythms simultaneously. Actual finger press increased single trial P300 selection accuracy of different subjects by 5-29.5% compared with silent counting; imaginary finger press did not increase the P300 selection accuracy apparently for most subjects except the two who were very poor at counting task. This showed by using different interface design and adopting certain mental response strategies, the `BCI illiteracy' may be cured.

"Single jet impinging verticial motion analysis of an underwater robot in the vicinity of a submerged surface","S. Bhattacharyya; H. H. Asada","Department of Mechanical Engineering, MIT","OCEANS 2016 - Shanghai","","2016","","","1","8","Anticipated growth of sub-sea technologies for security, infrastructure inspection, and exploration, motivates a deeper understanding of dynamics of underwater navigation in proximity to a submerged target surface. In this paper we discuss the phenomenon of a smooth, submersible micro robot with a single bottom jet that enables hovering and sliding over underwater surfaces. Such motion has applications to both visual and contact inspection methods of underwater surfaces: pipelines, oil rig infrastructure, ships, or even threats like underwater mines. Examples are air hockey, where disks move on a film of air (sliding); and hovercraft or vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) vehicles in proximity to the ground (hovering). The common feature is using the fluid between the body and an external surface to generate forces. The phenomenon is widely known in the context of motion over land and water surface, with air as the fluid, but has not been utilized for underwater motion. In our research we exploit the fluid flow between a submerged surface and a robot with a single active thrust jet coming out of the bottom. A lot of work has been done on single and double jets impinging on the ground for V/STOL, particularly for NASA, but no analogous studies exist on how a water jet affects the dynamics of an underwater drone moving near submerged surfaces. Preliminary results from simulations and initial experiments show unique phenomena of multiple stable equilibrium points with varying thrust forces. Further, for a fixed thrust force we demonstrate two stable regions: in extremely close proximity, when the robot rests on a thin fluid film which enables it to glide; and another with robot a body length or more away. Stability at close proximity is relevant to on-contact inspection such as ultrasonic testing. A larger gap has application in visual imaging, where a combination of thrust jets and ground effect lift enable the robot to hover at fixed distances from the targe- surface. This paper, through CFD simulations and preliminary experimental results, presents a basic robot design which is can be adapted for a wide range of underwater inspection tasks.","","","10.1109/OCEANSAP.2016.7485718","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485718","","Force;Inspection;Mobile robots;Sea surface;Vehicles;Visualization","autonomous underwater vehicles;computational fluid dynamics;design engineering;hydrodynamics;inspection;jets;pipelines;ultrasonic applications;vehicle dynamics","CFD simulations;NASA;V-STOL;basic robot design;contact inspection methods;fluid flow;ground effect lift;hovercraft;infrastructure inspection;land surface;oil rig infrastructure;on-contact inspection;pipelines;ships;single jet impinging verticial motion analysis;stability;submerged surface;submerged target surface;submersible microrobot;subsea technologies;thin fluid film;thrust jets;ultrasonic testing;underwater drone;underwater inspection tasks;underwater mines;underwater motion;underwater navigation dynamics;underwater robot;underwater surfaces;vertical-short takeoff and landing vehicles;water surface","","","","25","","","10-13 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, apply self-adaptive skin color detection in TSL color space where skin color data can be clustered to segment hand area. Second, acquire the distance signatures from hand shape contours and obtain possible finger points which reduce the hand gesture recognition problem into finding peaks of one dimensional signature. Last, finger points are labeled by the information of signature. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Analysis shows the proposed hand area detection method always gives a result in feasible area (TPR>0.91, FPR<;0.1) which is suitable for the following contour analysis, indicating that it's more stable and robust compared with other skin color based methods.

However, an industrial wireless protocol must cope with a great number of challenges in order to assure reliability and safety for these communications. The WirelessHART protocol is the first one developed to cope with industrial environments and is the most accepted by the factory managers nowadays. In this protocol, the route and link scheduling policy is dependent on the centralized network management algorithms and these algorithms may not be optimal. This paper presents an analysis of routing and scheduling data, obtained from a network deployed in laboratory. The acquired data allows to check message paths and the employed routing mechanisms. Temporal data for multi-hop message transmissions are also analyzed. The results revealed problems concerning temporal schedules due to the use of the first available but not optimal link for message transmission. This problem may lead to unnecessary latencies in the network since the manager routing and scheduling algorithms may not ensure the best path between the devices through the links.","","","10.1109/ICIT.2013.6505901","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6505901","Message routing mechanisms;Wireless networks analysis;WirelessHART protocol","Logic gates;Network topology;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Wireless communication","radio links;radio networks;scheduling;telecommunication network routing","centralized network management algorithms;factory managers;industrial environments;industrial wireless protocol;link scheduling policy;manager routing algorithms;manager scheduling algorithms;message paths;message transmission;multihop message transmissions;wireless HART network;wireless communication","","2","","11","","","25-28 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is true for most embedded systems and especially for safety-critical ones. A good requirements engineering process is vital for the development of high quality products, but these systems are often highly complex which complicates the respective activities. The use of natural language requirements is common practice, because they are easy to use and understand for people working in different engineering disciplines. However, natural language is ambiguous and vague and may lead to misunderstandings and incorrect implementations. Another big challenge is the often loose coupling of requirements and other development artifacts which hinders traceability and thus impact analysis. This paper presents an approach based on the Xtext framework for the implementation of a restricted requirements language to support engineers in writing requirements with higher quality. In order to improve tool integration, the approach supports OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration), which is a promising method to better support traceability using linked data principles. By using OSLC it is possible to easily extend existing requirements management tools with our proposed implementation for requirements semi-formalization as long as requirements management tools provide the respective OSLC interface. Finally, we will demonstrate our concepts using an example from the automotive domain. The example shows how the tool implementation can be integrated in a tool chain.","1089-6503;10896503","","10.1109/SEAA.2015.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7302444","Eclipse;Model-based Engineering;OSLC;Requirements Specification;Semi-formal Requirements;Xtext","Data models;Natural languages;Ontologies;Requirements management;Syntactics;Terminology;Writing","automotive engineering;formal specification;specification languages;systems analysis","OSLC interface;Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration;Xtext framework;automotive domain;embedded system;high quality product development;integrated model-based requirements engineering;linked data principles;natural language requirements;requirements management tools;requirements semiformalization;requirements writing;safety-critical system;tool integration;traceability","","","","26","","","26-28 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the important mechanisms to fully utilize the scarce bandwidth is congestion control. Especially, congestion detection, a module of congestion control, plays an essential role since the source rates should be adapted according to the detected network congestion. Due to the various dynamics of IEEE 802.11 WMNs, wireless congestion control mechanisms usually use complicated combination of various metrics, such as channel-idle time, interface queue length and average link-layer retransmission in intermediate nodes. However, this metric combination requires the sophisticated design of congestion control mechanism and eventually leads to the optimization difficulty. Thus, we propose a simple-yet-effective congestion detection metric, CORE (COngestion Residual timE). CORE measures the expected time of congestion-loss occurrence on the interface queue between IP and MAC layers. We obtain CORE by measuring the residual queue length and the slope of the queue length and then refining them with signal processing schemes (e.g., triangular moving average and linear regression). Moreover CORE provides over-generated rate information that is essential to the congestion control mechanisms. By taking a series of experiments, we verify that CORE accurately predicts the time of congestion-loss occurrence as well as the over-generated rate.","1738-9445;17389445","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5746031","","Accuracy;Bandwidth;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Linear regression;Monitoring;Time measurement","telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication standards;wireless mesh networks","CORE;IEEE 802.11 wireless mesh networks;accurate congestion detection method;average link-layer retransmission;channel-idle time;interface queue length;residual queue length;wireless congestion control","","0","","7","","","13-16 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If accessed by an attacker, these instruments may allow data to be leaked from the chips themselves or allow the attacker to drive other chips on the board. Finally, FPGA firmware is often stored in on-board memories and must be protected to prevent IP theft. In this paper, we describe some of the security issues facing boards.

In this study, a heterogeneously connected neural field model has been used which can replicate spatio-temporal patterns commonly observed in the EEG during generalized seizures. Seizure abatement has been formulated as an optimal control problem and the pseudospectral method has been used to develop stimuli with anti-ictogenic properties. The minimum energy optimal stimuli, developed in this study have been shown to abate seizures simulated from the model. It has been demonstrated that the control stimuli are spatially variant due to the underlying heterogeneity of the neural dynamics.

Blacksburg, Blacksburg, VA, USA","2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","","2015","","","3119","3126","The proposed inductive power transfer (IPT) system for laptop charging consists of three parts: a high frequency power supply from a full-bridge inverter with frequency modulation, a LLC resonant tank that incorporates a loosely coupled transformer (LCT) and a resonant capacitor series connected with the primary winding, and a rectification output circuits that uses a full-bridge diode rectifier. Due to the relatively large air gap, the magnetic coupling coefficient of the IPT system is significantly lower than that with tightly coupled transformer. As a result, the efficiency of the IPT system is always a major concern for applications with possible misalignment variation condition. To ensure high power transfer efficiency, the IPT system should have high tolerance for different misalignment conditions. In this paper, the effect of coupling coefficient deviation to compensation network efficiency is analyzed, and asymmetrical LCT which has significant higher misalignment tolerance is proposed. By using finite element analysis (FEA) simulation method, the performance of different transmitter and receiver coil dimensions are compared. In order to validate the performance of the proposed design, a 100-W hardware prototype with two sets of LCT is built and the corresponding experiments are carried out. As compared to the symmetrical LCT architecture, the proposed asymmetrical LCT prototype improves the coupling coefficient reduction from 70% to 12.5% when the misalignment ranges from 0 to 40 mm. Therefore, the efficiency deviation for the asymmetrical LCT is maintained nearly constant over the entire tested misalignment variation ranges.","2329-3721;23293721","","10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7310097","finite element analysis;inductive power transfer;loosely coupled transformer;misalignment","Batteries;Couplings;Integrated circuit modeling;Magnetic fields;Portable computers;Receivers;Windings","battery chargers;coils;finite element analysis;inductive power transmission;invertors;rectification;rectifiers;resonant power convertors;secondary cells;transformer windings","FEA simulation method;IPT system;LLC resonant tank;asymmetrical loosely coupled transformer;coupling coefficient reduction;finite element analysis simulation method;frequency modulation;full-bridge diode rectifier;full-bridge inverter;hardware prototype;high frequency power supply;higher misalignment tolerance;inductive power transfer system;laptop charging;magnetic coupling coefficient;power 100 W;primary winding;receiver coil;rectification output circuits;resonant capacitor series;transmitter coil;wireless laptop charger","","","","37","","","20-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the 2,500 mm mill of OJSC Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works (OAO MMK) as an example it has been proved that rolling is performed with tensions which exceed several times the accepted values. The main cause is incoordination of speeds of the continuous train electric drives. The developments carried out aim to improve accuracy of setting and controlling loop height in the inter-stand gap. The paper provides the structural diagram of the system of the cascading correction of the stand electric drive speeds.

Traditional methods learning the relationships by using either hand-labeled correspondence or batch-learning procedure are applicable when the environment remains unchanged. However, in many situations such as lighting changes, the environment varies seriously and hence traditional methods fail to work.

Furthermore, we propose a method that can avoid weak links and discover the true valid links among the entry/exit zones of cameras from the correspondence.

One alternative is to incorporate reconfigurability within a cognitive radio platform, thereby enabling the radio to adapt to dynamic RF spectrum environments. In this way, the radio is able to actively observe the RF spectrum, orient itself to the current RF environment, decide on a mode of operation, and act accordingly, thereby sharing the spectrum and operating in more a flexible manner. This research presents a novel architecture for the purpose of adapting radio operation to the current RF spectrum environment. Specifically, this research makes three contributions: (1) a framework for testing and evaluating clustering algorithms in the context of cognitive radio networks, (2) a new RF spectrum map merging technique for adaptive waveform selection, with initial integration testing on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and (3) a novel cognitive radio network emulation framework for testing and evaluating totally-ordered multicast as a means for inter-node communication.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746250","Cognitive radio;adaptive waveform;clustering;field programmable gate array;multicast;radio environment map","Clustering algorithms;Cognitive radio;Field programmable gate arrays;Measurement;Radio frequency;Testing;Vectors","cognitive radio;field programmable gate arrays;frequency hop communication;multicast communication;radio spectrum management","FPGA;RF spectrum map merging technique;adaptive waveform selection;clustering algorithm;cognitive radio network emulation framework;dynamic RF spectrum environments;field-programmable gate array;frequency hopping cognitive radio networks;initial integration testing;internode communication;radio devices;radio frequency spectrum;radio operation;spectrum sharing","","5","","17","","","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For the FETs, both single- and dual-gate devices are fabricated. The Si substrate is employed as the back gate in both the single- and dual-gate devices, while a top metal gate is employed as a second gate in the dual-gate devices.

The measurements reveal that the fabricated devices show the desired transistor characteristics. The measurements also demonstrate the possibility of realizing ambipolar transistors using InSb nanowires. For InSb nanowire quantum dots, both contact-induced Schottky-barrier-defined devices and top-finger-gate-defined devices are fabricated, and the Si substrate is used as a gate to tune the electron number in the quantum dots.

NP image registration, in particular, the technique of optimizing an objective function, containing similarity and regularization terms, provides a flexible approach for image registration. Here, we develop a NP registration approach, in which a normalized gradient field is used to quantify similarity, and curvature is used for regularization (NGF-Curv method). Using a survey of woodlands in southern Spain as an example, we show that NGF-Curv can be successful at fusing data sets when there is little prior knowledge about how the data sets are interrelated (i.e., in the absence of ground control points). The validity of NGF-Curv in airborne remote sensing is demonstrated by a series of experiments. We show that NGF-Curv is capable of aligning images precisely, making it a valuable component of algorithms designed to identify objects, such as trees, within multisensor data sets.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2431692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116541","Aerial photograph;hyperspectral image;image registration;light detection and ranging (LiDAR);remote sensing","Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Image registration;Laser radar;Sensors","geophysical image processing;image fusion;image registration;remote sensing by laser beam;vegetation mapping","Airborne LiDAR;NP registration approach;data set fusion;individual trees identification;multisensor airborne remote sensing;multisensor data sets;multisensor imaging;nonparametric image-registration techniques;normalized gradient field;wooded landscape hyperspectral imagery;wooded landscape photographic imagery;woodland biodiversity;woodland structure","","3","","62","","20150602","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The number of test cases may be extremely large for this application; therefore, it is hard for us to extensively test each software component given resource limitations. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework of incorporating path testing into reliability estimation for modular software systems. Three estimated methods based on common program structures, namely, sequence, branch, and loop structures, are proposed to calculate the path reliability. Consequently, the derived path reliabilities can be applied to the estimates of software reliability. Some experiments are performed based on two real systems. In addition, the accuracy and correlation with respect to the experiments are investigated by simulation and sensitivity analysis. Experimental results show that the path reliability has a high correlation to the actual software reliability. For software with loop structures, a smaller loop number can be assigned to derive an acceptable estimation of path reliability. Further, the sensitivity analysis can be used to identify critical modules and paths for resource allocation. It can be concluded that the proposed methods are useful and helpful for estimating software reliability and can be adaptively used in the early stages of software development.","0018-9529;00189529","","10.1109/TR.2011.2104490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5701674","Component-based software system;path testing;path-based software reliability prediction;white-box test","","program testing;sensitivity analysis;software reliability","adaptive reliability analysis;complex component-based software systems;modular software systems;path testing;reliability estimation;resource allocation;sensitivity analysis;software reliability methods","","19","1","50","","20110124","March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Active power injection is developed by a reference power point tracking and reactive power regulation by controlling the node voltage, both with dq current control with the different power priority possibilities. The studied topology is based on a single-stage traditional inverter but the control algorithm philosophy is valid for any topology. The whole system has been simulated in order to validate the control algorithm and tune the controller for obtaining the best transient response with zero steady state.","2163-5137;21635137","","10.1109/ISIE.2014.6864933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6864933","Current control;Photovoltaic systems;Power control;Power conversion;Power system simulation;Reactive power;Smart-grid;Voltage control","Control systems;Inverters;Photovoltaic systems;Reactive power;Smart grids;Voltage control","distributed power generation;electric current control;invertors;photovoltaic power systems;reactive power control;smart power grids;voltage control","active power injection;balance reactive power control;distributed generation;dq current control;injection active power control;node voltage control;photovoltaic power plants generation;point of common coupling;reactive power regulation;reference power point tracking;renewable energy;single-stage traditional inverter;smart grids;voltage regulation","","3","","17","","","1-4 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has become a very tedious task to find the relevant information from Web search engines. Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of our country. Farmers, producers, supply-chain managers, extension workers, researchers and academicians are some of the important stakeholders in the field of agriculture. Web has now become an important medium for dissemination of information required by all of these. But, the retrieval of desired information from Web is a difficult task as it requires sifting through all the search results and identifying correct Web pages. A solution to this problem is personalization of search results according to user interests and preferences. Further, semantic Web and multi-agent technology is playing an important role in adding the meaning to the Web contents. At present, very little efforts have seen in applying personalization using semantic Web and agent technology in the area of agriculture. This research proposes a framework based on semantic Web and agent technology for the retrieval of personalized information from Web in agriculture domain. This would help stakeholders in accessing the required information easily and efficiently through agents.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100383","Agents;Agriculture;Information;Personalization;Semantic;Web","Agriculture;Data mining;Intelligent agents;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Semantics","agricultural engineering;information dissemination;information retrieval;multi-agent systems;semantic Web","Web contents;Web search engines;agent-based personalized information retrieval;agriculture domain;correct Web page identification;information dissemination;multiagent technology;search result personalization;semantic Web;semantics framework;user interests;user preferences","","0","","11","","","11-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, without proper planning, the dense deployment of SCNs may cause severe interference, resulting in limited capacity. In hotspots with a large number of users, the small cell network is challenged by the extremely high aggregated capacity requirement and may fail to guarantee the quality of service of all users. To leverage the benefits of SCNs and overcome the drawbacks, we propose a cooperative small cell network, CSCN, architecture that jointly utilizes several advanced techniques to enhance the capacity of hotspots. In this article, we first examine the existing solutions for capacity enhancement and hotspots. We then present the basic concept of the proposed CSCN architecture, and discuss the related technical aspects. The high potential of a CSCN in terms of capacity improvement and interference mitigation is demonstrated by a simulation study. Finally, we present several open problems for future research based on the CSCN architecture.","1536-1284;15361284","","10.1109/MWC.2014.7000978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000978","","Computer architecture;Directional antennas;Interference;Microcell networks;Microprocessors;Mobile communication;Quality of service;Resource management","cooperative communication;interference;mobile communication","CSCN architecture;SCN;capacity enhancement;cooperative small cell networks;interference mitigation;mobile communication systems;spatial reuse;spectral efficiency","","5","","15","","","December 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It provides application-aware data layout policies, together with RS data object based data I/O interfaces, for efficient support of various data access patterns of RS applications from the server side. With the prior knowledge of the desired RS data access patterns, HPGFS could offer relevant space-filling curves to organize the sliced 3-D data bricks and distribute them over I/O servers. In this way, data layouts consistent with expected data access patterns could be created to explore data locality and achieve performance improvement. Moreover, the multi-band RS data with complex structured geographical metadata could be accessed and managed as a single data object.

To explore the potential changes, we used a Real-Time Simulation (RTS) methodology with Power-Hardware-In-the-Loop (PHIL) capabilities (i.e. circuit simulator coupled with power amplifiers for driving external physical power devices). The RTS-PHIL is a powerful approach that makes it possible to incorporate the actual transient reaction of the hardware under study without the need for developing a complicated numerical model, while the power system circuit, generally simpler in nature, can be purely simulated. In this project, the response of a commercial protection relay in the presence of a SFCL was investigated. Both the relay and a small scale shielded-core inductive limiter were coupled to the real time simulator (HYPERSIM) through single-phase linear power amplifiers and a variety of faults were applied. So far, this setup has allowed us to evaluate the impact of inserting a SFCL on overcurrent relays (OCR), in a simple radial distribution network. The results show that coordination has indeed to be slightly revised.","1051-8223;10518223","","10.1109/TASC.2010.2084060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5621851","Fault current limiters;power hardware in the loop;power systems;protection devices","Circuit faults;Fault current limiters;High temperature superconductors;Integrated circuit modeling;Optical character recognition software;Power systems;Relays","power amplifiers;power distribution faults;power distribution protection;power system relaying;superconducting fault current limiters","HYPERSIM;current limiting characteristics prediction;electric power network;overcurrent relay;power system circuit;power system network protection;power-hardware-in-the-loop;protection relay;radial distribution network;real-time simulation;shielded-core inductive limiter;single-phase linear power amplifier;superconducting fault current limiter;transient reaction","","2","","16","","20101109","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The pgfkeys package is a part of the “portable graphics format” bundle of packages. This study concerns primarily the extensions of keyval and xkeyval packages by the ltxkeys package and not pgfkeys package, although ltxkeys provides tools that are not available in pgfkeys. The keyval and xkeyval packages are known to lack the level of robustness required for some modern applications of the machinery of keys in (LA)TEX. Specifically, they strip off outer curly braces in values of keys and are unable to parse key values that contain unbalanced conditionals. For large scale projects, the “selective sanitization” used by xkeyval package does slow down key processing. The keyval package can define only one type of key, while the xkeyval package can define up to four types of key. Four might sound many for key management, but the types of key that xkeyval package can handle are not sufficient to meet modern needs. Moreover, when it comes to defining several keys (of the same or different types), these packages require a relatively large estate to achieve this task. The ltxkeys package substantially extends the robustness and functionality of the keyval and xkeyval packages. Robustness results from the ability of the ltxkeys package to preserve outer braces in key values throughout parsing, as well as parse key values with unbalanced conditionals. The ltxkeys package can compactly define up to seven types of key, and, unlike in the keyval and xkeyval packages, it does provide for the definition of keys whose callback macros expect multi-parametered and delimited arguments. The ltxkeys package also introduces and robustly implements the concepts of key commands, key environments, pathkeys, amongst other new ideas in key management in (LA)TEX.","","","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6234179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6234179","","Cities and towns;Educational institutions;Robustness","grammars;high level languages;software packages","LATEX;delimited arguments;key commands;key environments;key management;large scale projects;ltxkeys;multiparametered arguments;pathkeys;pgfkeys package;portable graphics format;robust key parser;selective sanitization;xkeyval package","","0","","22","","","29-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A multitude of characterization techniques have been exploited on CdS films after various stages in the process of device fabrication as the CdS properties change significantly upon processing of the films. For this purpose we compared the properties for as-deposited films, films that are exposed to a CdTe deposition heating profile without the actual CdTe deposition, as well as CdS films as they appear within completed devices. Especially the CdCl<sub>2</sub> process turned out to result in huge changes within the CdS film. From this study it is concluded that significant changes occur to the CdS film depending on its starting density.

First, we present a mechanism for obtaining P300-confidence using a real-time Bayesian dynamic stopping framework that makes novel use of additional stimuli that occur due to epoch and filter delays. Second, we propose an ensemble of decision trees to combine ErrP and P300-confidence features. Third, we describe the unique attentional differences between error and correct feedback in our spelling interface and discuss how these differences affect ErrP physiology. We tested online error detection on 11 typically developed adults using a BCI system trained on a previous day and found an average sensitivity of 86.67% and specificity of 96.59%. Automatic correction increased selection accuracy by 13.67% and utility grew by a factor of 4.48. We found, however, that the improved performance was primarily attributable to the inclusion of P300 confidence in error detection, calling into question the significance of single-trial ErrP detection.","1534-4320;15344320","","10.1109/TNSRE.2015.2461495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7217833","Brain–computer interface;EEG;P300 speller;dynamic stopping;error-related potential","Accuracy;Ash;Delays;Detectors;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Training","Bayes methods;brain-computer interfaces;decision trees;electroencephalography;error analysis;handicapped aids;spelling aids","BCI speller;BCI system;ErrP physiology;P300-confidence features;P300-speller confidence;attentional differences;auto-correction;brain-computer interface spellers;communication;correct feedback;correction accuracy;decision trees;epoch delays;error feedback;error-related potential scores;filter delays;online single-trial error detection;physical disabilities;real-time Bayesian dynamic stopping framework;real-time Bayesian ranks;single-trial ErrP detection","","2","","55","","20150821","Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Exploiting Task Order Information for Optimizing Sequentially Consistent Java Programs","C. M. Angerer; T. R. Gross","ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT), 2011 International Conference on","","2011","","","393","402","Java was designed as a secure language that supports running untrusted code as part of trusted applications. For safety reasons, Java therefore defines a memory model that prevents undefined behavior in multi-threaded programs even if the programs are not correctly synchronized. Because of the potential negative performance impact the Java designers did not choose a simple and natural memory model, such as sequential consistency, but instead developed a relaxed memory model that gives the compiler more optimization opportunities. As it is today, however, the relaxed Java Memory Model is not only hard to understand but it unnecessarily complicates reasoning about parallel programs and it turned out to be difficult to implement correctly. This paper presents an optimizing compiler for a Java version that has sequential consistency as its memory model. Based on a programming model with explicit happens-before constraints between tasks, we describe a static schedule analysis that computes whether two tasks may be executed in parallel or if they are ordered. During optimization, the task-ordering information is exploited to reduce the number of volatile memory accesses the compiler must insert to guarantee sequential consistency. The evaluation shows that scheduling information significantly improves the effectiveness of the optimizations. For our set of multi-threaded benchmarks the fully optimizing compiler removes between 70% and 100% of the volatile memory accesses inserted by the non-optimizing compiler. As a result, the overhead of sequentially consistent Java compared to standard Java is reduced from 136% on average for the unoptimized version to 11% on average for the optimized version. The results indicate that with appropriate optimizations, sequential consistency can be a feasible alternative to the Java Memory Model.","1089-795X;1089795X","","10.1109/PACT.2011.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113847","Compiler;Optimization;Parallel Programming;Sequential Consistency","Instruction sets;Java;Optimization;Runtime;Schedules;Synchronization","Java;multi-threading;optimising compilers;scheduling","Java memory model;multithreaded program;optimizing compiler;sequentially consistent Java program;static schedule analysis;task-ordering information;volatile memory access","","0","","23","","","10-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Social networking environments typically promote the organization of their users according to groups of individuals who are related through their common characteristics, interests, and interactions. In this paper we present an approach for assisting the user in the evaluation of popularity of the information shared in the context of social networking groups, and we propose a model for measuring the relevance of a user to a group and the group relevance for its members, based on the popularity and freshness of the contents posted by the users.

The system consists of one multi-antenna transmitter, several multi-antenna energy receivers (ERs) and one single-antenna co-located receiver (CR) who adopts a power splitter to decode information and harvest power simultaneously. We consider the artificial noise (AN) embedded information-bearing signal to interfere potential eavesdroppers (i.e., ERs) and capture the harvested power. We perform joint optimization for the masked beamforming matrix, the AN covariance matrix and the power splitting ratio, such that the transmit power is minimized to satisfy the target secrecy rate of the CR, the total transmit power and the energy harvesting constraints for the CR and the ERs. By incorporating norm-bounded channel uncertainty model, we propose a robust joint design method to obtain the optimal solution. Also, a suboptimal algorithm for the outage constrained robust optimization problem is proposed by adopting the Bernstein-type inequality. Furthermore, the tightness of the relaxation for the proposed schemes are verified by showing that the optimal solution of the relaxed problem is rank-one.

Useful diagnostic tools to detect the causes of poor linearity are the linearity and intermodulation errors, which can be evaluated from INL measurements. Linearity and intermodulation errors highlight and quantify erroneous calibration and unwanted interactions between current sources inside the DAC hardware. Unfortunately, their estimates, especially those related to high order intermodulation errors are characterized by high uncertainty. It is thus difficult assessing their relevance on the base of their very uncertain value. It is shown that by means of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) the relevance of intermodulation errors can be assessed from a limited set of INL measurements. ANOVA is in fact capable of distinguishing if the variance in INL measurements has to be addressed to active factors or noise, even if the effect of each factor is widespread upon different elements of the INL array and in different combinations with the other factors.","1091-5281;10915281","","10.1109/IMTC.2011.5944196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5944196","contrasts;integral nonlinearity;intermodulation errors;linearity errors;test matrix","Analysis of variance;Linearity;Matrix converters;Noise;Software;Uncertainty;Voltage measurement","calibration;constant current sources;digital-analogue conversion;intermodulation;statistical analysis","ANOVA approach;DAC linearity evaluation;INL array;INL measurement;analysis of variance approach;current source;digital to analog converter;erroneous calibration;high order intermodulation error;integral nonlinearity","","0","","12","","","10-12 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Processing packets to serve these functions often require multiple middlebox resources, e.g., CPU and link band-width. Furthermore, different packet traffic flows may consume significantly different amounts of various resources, depending on the network functions that are applied. Multi-resource fair queueing is therefore needed to allow flows to share multiple middlebox resources in a fair manner. In this paper, we clarify the fairness requirements of a queueing scheme and present Dominant Resource Generalized Processor Sharing (DRGPS), a fluid flow-based fair queueing idealization that strictly realizes Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) at all times. As a form of Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) running on multiple resources, DRGPS serves as a benchmark that practical packet-by-packet fair queueing algorithm should follow. With DRGPS, techniques and insights that have been developed for traditional fair queueing can be leveraged to schedule multiple resources.

Our mosaicing algorithm exploits the known, rigid connection between a combined white light and OCT imaging system to reduce the computational complexity of traditional volumetric mosaicing pipelines. Specifically, the search for 3-D point correspondences is replaced by two, 2-D processing steps: We first coregister a pair of white light images in 2-D and then generate a surface map based on the volumetric OCT data, which is used to convert 2-D image homographies into 3-D volumetric transformations. A significant benefit of our dual-modality approach is its tolerance for feature-poor datasets such as bladder tissue; in contrast, approaches to mosaic feature-rich volumes with significant variations in the local intensity gradient (e.g., retinal data containing prolific vasculature) are not suitable for such feature-poor datasets. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using ex vivo bladder tissue and a custom tissue-mimicking phantom. The algorithm shows excellent performance over the range of volume-to-volume transformations expected during endoscopic examination and comparable accuracy with several orders of magnitude superior run times than an open-source gold-standard algorithm (N-SIFT). We anticipate the proposed algorithm can benefit bladder surveillance and surgical planning.

A notable characteristic of TVC is that an extra tag can be revealed by folding up each share, which provides users with supplementary information such as augmented message or distinguishable patterns to identify the shares. The tagging property can easily be applied to any reported VC scheme to endow the generated shares with more capabilities.

Several use cases exist that make use of these capabilities, ranging from monitoring of physical infrastructures to pre selecting video surveillance feeds for human inspection. It is difficult to predict how much computing resources are needed for these stream processing platforms, because the volume and velocity of input data may vary over time. The open source Apache Storm software provides a framework for developers to build processing applications that use the computing resources of all machines within an established cluster. Because of the varying processing needs of such applications, the platform should be able to automatically grow and shrink as needed. Unfortunately, the current Storm platform does not provide this capability. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a tool that monitors several aspects of the Storm platform, the applications running on top of it, and external systems such as queues and databases. Based on this information, the tool decides whether extra servers are needed or machines may be decommissioned from the cluster, and then acts upon it by actually creating new virtual machines or shutting them down.","","","10.1109/BigDataService.2015.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7184876","Analysis Platform;Apache Storm;Big Data;Cloud Computing;Dynamic Scaling;Elasticity;Streaming Data","Fasteners;Measurement;Monitoring;Software;Storms;Topology;Virtual machining","data analysis;inspection;video surveillance;virtual machines","Apache storm;human inspection;physical infrastructures;stream processing platforms;streaming data analysis;video surveillance;virtual machines","","0","","29","","","March 30 2015-April 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because most cases of liver cancer in Egypt are detected in very late stages, the use of surgical resection, liver transplantation and percutaneous ablative therapies constitutes unsuitable therapeutic options either due to high recurrence rate or unfeasibility. Therapy sessions can be made through the introduction of chemotherapy using a catheter directly into the hepatic artery supplying the tumor guided by angiography imaging system. This method of treatment known to prevent the patient from different problems associated with surgical treatment, but it is still needs to be further improved to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks. Hepatic angiography is an x-ray study of the blood vessels that supply the liver. The procedure uses a catheter that is placed into a blood vessel through a small incision. The catheter is guided using the x-ray images obtained through the interventional session. During angiography, hepatic arterial supply is usually displayed in one, two or three projections. Mental 3D interpretation of the anatomy is not an easy task. Reaching the target supply artery by the catheter tip is mandatory to obtain satisfactory tumor response and reduce complications and recurrence. This work aims to develop an interactive 3D imaging system of hepatic angiography. The developed system uses a set of 2D images measured over few view angles to reconstruct a full 3D volume of the hepatic arteries. The problem can be thought as a combination of three main approaches. (1) Image reconstruction of 3D artery volume from few number of projections (each is presented as 2D image), (2) automatic detection of the catheter roadmap to the labeled artery which feed the tumor, and (3) interactive system to control and display images using simple gestures of the physicia- .","1082-3654;10823654","","10.1109/NSSMIC.2013.6829039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829039","Image reconstruction;TACE;computed tomography;hepatic angiography;interactive control;ubiquitous computing","Angiography;Arteries;Catheters;Image reconstruction;Three-dimensional displays;Tumors","blood vessels;cancer;diagnostic radiography;image reconstruction;interactive systems;liver;medical image processing;patient treatment;tumours","X-ray images;blood vessels;catheter;chemotherapy;full 3D volume reconstruction;healthcare;hepatic angiography;hepatic artery;hepatitis;image reconstruction;interactive 3D imaging system;interventional session;liver hepatocellular carcinoma;tumor","","0","","10","","","Oct. 27 2013-Nov. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A net-centric approach is a strategy to improve information value, to enable stakeholders to extend their reach to additional data sources, share Situational Awareness (SA), synchronise effort and optimise resource use to deliver maximum (or proportionate) effect in support of goals. This paper takes a systems perspective to understand the dynamics within a net-centric information system. This paper presents the first stages of the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM), to develop a conceptual model of the human activity system and develop a system dynamics model to represent system behaviour, that will inform future research into a net-centric approach with information security. Our model supports the net-centric hypothesis that participation within a information sharing community extends information reach, improves organisation SA allowing proactive action to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce overall risk within the community. The system dynamics model provides organisations with tools to better understand the value of a net-centric approach, a framework to determine their own maturity and evaluate strategic relationships with collaborative communities.","1062-922X;1062922X","","10.1109/SMC.2014.6973986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973986","Command and Control;Distributed Information Systems;Net-Centric;Situational Awareness;System Dynamics","Collaboration;Communities;Information security;Modeling","information systems;security of data","SA;SSM;collaborative communities;complexity;data sources;human activity system;information environment;information reach;information security;information sharing community;information value;interdependent dynamic relationships;net-centric approach;net-centric cyber defence system development;net-centric hypothesis;net-centric information system;situational awareness;sociotechnical systems;soft systems methodology;system behaviour;system dynamics model","","0","","15","","","5-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ultimate aim is to support people with less supported or caretakers and to phase-out traditional old-age homes. Many frail elders are admitted to free homes run by NGO's by their relatives. To alleviate this problem, Big data plays major role in monitoring the elderly persons for earlier diagnosis of health problem. Big Data has a large potential in healthcare. It gathers all the vital signs of the individual and if any abnormalities are noted it is been send to experts for observation which are received by wearable sensors.

It is hard to prove that a metric is valid, i.e., that measured numerical values imply anything on the vaguely defined, yet crucial software properties such as complexity and maintainability. This paper employs statistical analysis and tests to check some plausible assumptions on the behavior of software and metrics measured for this software in retrospective on its versions evolution history. Among those are the reliability assumption implicit in the application of any code metric, and the assumption that the magnitude of change, i.e., increase or decrease of its size, in a software artifact is correlated with changes to its version number.

Surprisingly, we show that a substantial portion of the reliability of some metrics can be observed even in random changes to architecture. Another surprising result is that Boolean-valued metrics tend to flip their values more often in minor software version increments than in major increments.","2160-1852;21601852","","10.1109/MSR.2012.6224285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224285","","Java;Measurement;Software reliability;Software systems;Taxonomy","Boolean functions;configuration management;software architecture;software metrics;statistical analysis","Boolean-valued metrics;numerical values;software architecture;software artifact;software metrics;software properties over time;software version increments;statistical analysis;statistical tests;version number;versions evolution history","","0","","16","","","2-3 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Shortcut-JFS: A write efficient journaling file system for phase change memory","E. Lee; S. Yoo; J. E. Jang; H.

However, existing journaling file systems are not efficient for emerging PCM (Phase Change Memory) storage. Specifically, a large amount of write operations performed by journaling incur serious performance degradation of PCM storage as it has long write latency. In this paper, we present a new journaling file system for PCM, called Shortcut-JFS, that reduces write amount of journaling by more than a half exploiting the byte-accessibility of PCM. Specifically, Shortcut-JFS performs two novel schemes, 1) differential logging that performs journaling only for modified bytes and 2) in-place checkpointing that removes unnecessary block copy overhead. We implemented Shortcut-JFS on Linux 2.6, and measured the performance of Shortcut-JFS and legacy journaling schemes used in ext 3. The results show that the performance improvement of Shortcut-JFS against ext 3 is 40% on average.","2160-195X;2160195X","","10.1109/MSST.2012.6232378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6232378","File Systems;Journaling;Phase Change Memory","Checkpointing;File systems;Nonvolatile memory;Performance evaluation;Phase change materials;Random access memory;Throughput","Linux;checkpointing;phase change memories","Linux 2.6;PCM storage;Shortcut-JFS;block copy overhead;byte accessibility;computer system;in-place checkpointing;legacy journaling scheme;phase change memory;write efficient journaling file system;write latency;write operation","","15","","28","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary design goal is to devise a system capable of persistent operation for the duration of the life cycle of a target structure. It should be deployable during the construction phase and reconfigurable thereafter, suitable for continuous long-term monitoring. In addition to selecting the most energy efficient useful components to ensure the lowest possible power consumption, it is necessary to consider sources of energy other than, or complementary to, batteries. Thus, the platform incorporates multisource energy harvesting, electrochemical fuel cell (FC), energy storage, recharging capability, and intelligent operation through real-time energy information exchange with the primary controller. It is shown that, with appropriate integration, the device will have sufficient energy to operate perpetually in a distributed WSHM application. This conclusion is demonstrated through experimental results, simulations, and empirical measurements that demonstrate the high-efficiency energy conversion of the harvesters (up to 86%) and low-power characteristics of the platform (less than 1 mW in sleep mode). It is shown that energy autonomy is comfortably achievable for duty cycles up to 0.75%, meeting the demands of the application, and up to 1.5%, invoking the FC.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2013.2267694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542745","Energy efficiency;fuel cell;multisource energy harvesting;power electronics;power management;wireless sensor networks","","condition monitoring;energy harvesting;energy storage;fuel cells;secondary cells;structural engineering;wireless sensor networks","batteries;continuous long-term monitoring;distributed WSHM;electrochemical fuel cell;energy efficient useful components;energy sources;energy storage;extended wireless monitoring;high-efficiency energy conversion;intelligent hybrid energy supply;intelligent operation;multisource energy harvesting;power consumption;real-time energy information exchange;recharging capability;target structure life cycle;wireless structural health monitoring","","32","","34","","20130618","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Instead of using the conventional Cartesian coordinate system, hexagonal coordinate system is used to characterize the space vectors. This representation eliminates fractional arithmetic and makes the scheme computationally efficient. The switching vectors are directly determined from the hexagonal coordinates using simple arithmetic relations.

In this paper, we present an independent component analysis based technique to mitigate these signal artifacts. We propose a new statistical measure to enable an automatic identification and removal of independent components, which correspond to the sources of noise. For the first time, we also present a signal-dependent closed-loop system for the quality assessment of the denoised ECG. In one experiment, noisy data is obtained by the addition of calibrated amounts of noise from the MIT-BIH NST database to the AHA ECG database. Arrhythmia classification based on a state-of-the-art algorithm with the direct use of noisy data thus obtained shows sensitivity and positive predictivity values of 87.7% and 90.0%, respectively, at an input signal SNR of -9 dB. Detection with the use of ECG data denoised by the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in the performance of the classifier with the corresponding results being 96.5% and 99.1%, respectively. In a related lab trial, we demonstrate a reduction in RMS error of instantaneous heart rate estimates from 47.2% to 7.0% with the use of 56 minutes of denoised ECG from four physically active subjects.

In integrated supply chain, the supplier needs to adjust the retail price if demand deviation is in certain range. The supplier needs to adjust the retail price and the production quantities if the deviation is large enough. In decentralized decision, the supply chain cannot be coordinated. This means that the original revenue-sharing contract cannot coordinate the disrupted supply chain. An improved revenue-sharing contract is put forward to coordinate the disrupted supply chain. The research shows that the improved contract can coordinate the original supply chain and the disrupted supply chain, which means that the contract has robustness when facing the demand deviation.

Yet, the mere capability to detect such small deformations is not sufficient for an operational application of the technique. Handling huge data volumes, homogenizing independent datasets, and the connection with expert knowledge to identify risk areas are challenges to overcome. Here, we use a probabilistic method for InSAR time series postprocessing to efficiently scrutinize the data and detect railway instability. Moreover, to detect high-strain segments of the railway, we propose a short-arc-based method to focus on localized differential deformation between nearby InSAR measurement points.

However, different from the three-phase MMC, single-phase has exclusive capacitor in the dc bus. As a result, voltage boosting stage of single-phase MMC has to take both the submodule capacitor and dc bus capacitor into consideration, and has become an obstacle for single-phase MMC. This paper presents a pre-charging scheme for a single-phase half-bridge sub-module (HBSM)-based MMC. The uncontrolled rectifying stage is also adopted. The sum and the difference of energy between the upper and lower arms are controlled to realize the voltage boosting of sub-modules. Moreover, the dc bus capacitors are charged to the rated voltage value by the rest energy flowing from the AC side. This control scheme can make the starting process rapidly, smoothly and stably, which is of great value for a single-phase MMC operating as a rectifier. A prototype of a single-phase MMC with 8 submodules per arm was built to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed control scheme.","","","10.1049/cp.2015.0336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7446493","DC capacitor;Pre-charging control scheme;Single-phase MMC","","convertors;voltage control","HBSM;dc bus capacitor;precharging control scheme;single-phase half-bridge submodule;single-phase modular multilevel converter;submodule capacitor;three-phase MMC;uncontrolled rectifying stage;voltage boosting control scheme","","","","","","","17-18 Oct. 2015","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Research questions: What role do trust and team cohesion play in the relationship between coordination effectiveness and team performance of global virtual teams with two distinct subgroups? Literature review: Prior research suggests that coordination effectiveness on team performance is most strongly impacted by coordination of knowledge. This effectiveness is mediated by trust and team cohesion. However, we have a poor understanding of trust and team cohesion dynamics on intergroup relationships in global virtual teams. Methodology: A survey was conducted with 14 teams with a total of 112 participants in the US and India. The teams were tasked with evaluating customer-relationship-management best practices for a global environment. Results and discussion: We evaluated how the process of effective coordination for teams composed of two colocated subgroups is mediated by individual perceptions of out-group trust and overall team cohesion. Our findings show that individual trust and team cohesion share a reciprocal impact on each other, suggesting that effective coordination in virtual teams can create a positive feedback loop with trust and cohesion, improving overall project performance. Implications for theory and practice include the virtuous cycle that trust and cohesion create in global virtual team coordination and the necessity of establishing appropriate project coordination systems and processes to promote both aspects and, thus, achieve excellent project performance for colocated subgroups.","0361-1434;03611434","","10.1109/TPC.2016.2583319","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552617","Collaborative work;computer-mediated communication;coordination effectiveness;global virtual teams;performance;team cohesion;trust","Adaptation models;Bibliographies;Context;Global communication;Organizations;Virtual groups","project management;team working","India;USA;customer-relationship-management best practices;global virtual team performance;intergroup relationship;knowledge coordination;positive feedback loop;project coordination system;project performance;subgroup formation;team cohesion dynamics;team coordination effectiveness;team trust","","","","","","","Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, a lack of common standards used by different cloud providers and the complexity of cloud resource distribution and orchestration often lead to an excess in resource pool allocation and overall inefficiencies. This complexity percolates throughout the cloud service industry and is the real hindrance to the use of the utility service model especially in healthcare organizations, which are expected to provide new and improved patient care capabilities using cloud resources. In this paper, a single cloud unit for metering all resources relating to the delivery of cloud computing is developed and implemented. This unit represents the summation of weighted components (network, compute, storage, power, facilities, etc.) used in the delivery of a cloud service. Performance results observed in the actual implementation of an enterprise cloud showed that the proposed unit provides an easy to use tool for comparing CSP services, and can lead to increased efficiency and manageability of resource usage in an enterprise.","","","10.1109/IHTC.2015.7238044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238044","Cloud Computing;Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS);Pricing Models;Utility Computing","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Organizations;Pricing;Resource management;Standards organizations","cloud computing;resource allocation","CSP services;CSPs;cloud computing;cloud measurement;cloud resource distribution complexity;cloud resource orchestration complexity;cloud service industry;cloud service providers;enterprise cloud;healthcare organizations;patient care capability;resource pool allocation;single cloud unit;universal unit;utility computing service model;weighted components","","1","","17","","","May 31 2015-June 4 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Knauss","Software Eng., Gothenburg Univ., Gothenburg, Sweden","2015 IEEE 23rd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)","","2015","","","294","295","AUTOSAR has changed significantly how software is developed in the automotive sector. As a central standard, AUTOSAR enables reuse of software components as well as their interoperability. For AUTOSAR compliant ECU development, car manufacturers source Electronic Control Units (ECUs) from Tier-1 suppliers, but ask those Tier-1 suppliers to install AUTOSAR compliant basic software from a certified AUTOSAR-Tier-2 supplier. In this setup (to which we refer as the AUTOSAR ecosystem), the OEM has a direct business relationship with the Tier-1, but only an indirect relationship to the AUTOSAR-Tier-2 supplier, which leads to complex flows of requirements and related information between the organizations involved. In this extended abstract, we summarize preliminary results of a qualitative investigation of Requirements Engineering challenges in the AUTOSAR ecosystem. In particular, we interviewed 7 project managers from an AUTOSAR-Tier-2 supplier, and triangulated our results with 6 additional interviews with subjects from two Tier-1 suppliers and one OEM. We found that most of the requirements towards the AUTOSAR-Tier-2 supplier can be directly mapped to standard AUTOSAR components. However, a significant amount of requirements were new requirements and specific to the OEM or even a project. The well-known requirements engineering challenges we found to surface in the AUTOSAR ecosystem were mainly connected to these non-standard requirements. Standard and non-standard requirements are usually mixed, which makes it hard to fully leverage the potential benefits of reuse within the AUTOSAR standard. We argue that the holistic ecosystem perspective allows exploration of new strategies for mitigating this challenge.","1090-705X;1090705X","","10.1109/RE.2015.7320445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320445","","Automotive engineering;Business;Ecosystems;Requirements engineering;Software;Software engineering;Standards","automotive engineering;formal specification;object-oriented programming","AUTOSAR compliant ECU development;AUTOSAR ecosystems;automotive sector;car manufacturers;central standard;certified AUTOSAR-Tier-2 supplier;direct business relationship;electronic control units;holistic ecosystem perspective;interoperability;nonstandard requirements;requirements engineering;software components;tier-1 suppliers","","1","","6","","","24-28 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we investigate how user cooperation can further reduce the energy consumption of a cellular network that uses SM strategies. In particular, we study how sleeping periods can be extended when users tolerate a delay before the start of their service. We propose two delay-tolerant-user-aware SM strategies and provide mathematical grounds for the evaluation of their performance. We evaluate the strategies in the context of LTE networks with realistic daily traffic patterns.

However, controlling a robot remotely via a conventional monitor and control panel can be difficult and slow. To achieve faster and more dexterous operation of the robot, enhanced 3D perception and some form of tactile or neural feedback is needed to achieve some degree of embodiment within the robot's physical structure and world. To achieve this objective we have devised an immersive tele-operation system comprised of a stereo vision headset and an electro-tactile feedback system that is worn by the operator, connected to stereo cameras and various sensors mounded on the robot. This arrangement enables the remote operator to see in 3D what the robot sees and experience what the robot feels via electro-tactile feedback in response to hand gesture based control actions.

However, such a system essentially requires a two-stage power conversion process, which significantly increases the power losses. Furthermore, the poor power factor associated with DAB converters further reduces the efficiency of such systems. This paper proposes a novel matrix converter based resonant DAB converter that requires only a single-stage power conversion process to facilitate isolated bi-directional power transfer between EVs and the grid. The proposed converter comprises a matrix converter based front end linked with an EV side full-bridge converter through a high frequency isolation transformer and a tuned LCL network. A mathematical model, which predicts the behavior of the proposed system, is presented to show that both the magnitude and direction of the power flow can be controlled through either relative phase angle or magnitude modulation of voltages produced by converters. Viability of the proposed concept is verified through simulations. The proposed matrix converter based DAB, with a single power conversion stage, is low in cost, and suites charging and discharging in single or multiple EVs or V2G applications.","1947-1262;19471262","","10.1109/ASSCC.2012.6523319","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6523319","DAB;Resonant Converter;V2G","","battery chargers;bridge circuits;electric vehicles;high-frequency transformers;load flow;matrix convertors;power factor;resonant power convertors","DAB converters;LCL network;V2G applications;electric vehicles;full-bridge converter;high frequency isolation transformer;isolated bidirectional power transfer;magnitude modulation;matrix converter;power factor;power flow;power losses;relative phase angle;resonant dual active bridge;two-stage power conversion;vehicle-to-grid system","","5","","18","","","12-14 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Peng","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2016","PP","99","1","1","A solid state variable capacitor (SSVC) with minimum capacitor is proposed. A variable AC capacitor (with capacitance varied from 0 to Cac) is traditionally implemented by an H-bridge inverter and a large electrolytic DC capacitor, whose capacitance is 20 times of the AC capacitor’s value, in order to absorb the ripple power pulsating at twice the line frequency (2 ripple power). The proposed SSVC system consists of an H-bridge and an additional phase leg connected to an AC capacitor with fixed capacitance, Cac and can reduce the DC capacitance to minimum value for absorbing switching ripples. The AC capacitor absorbs the 2 component and theoretically can eliminate 2 ripples to the DC capacitor completely. The total capacitor size is reduced by 13 times if same type capacitors (film) are used. Moreover, the proposed SSVC shows special advantages in terms of the switches’ current and voltage stress compared to other applications and the total device power rating is only 1.125 times of H-bridge. Since the proposed SSVC only has a small DC capacitor, a novel control system directly based on ripple power is also proposed to achieve stable DC voltage and fast dynamic response. Simulation and experimental results are shown to prove the effectiveness of the proposed SSVC with minimum capacitor.","0885-8993;08858993","","10.1109/TPEL.2016.2606582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7565551","","Capacitance;Capacitors;Control systems;Inverters;Legged locomotion;Stress;Voltage control","","","","","","","","20160913","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To encode facial expression dynamics, we extend the purely spatial representation LPQ to a dynamic texture descriptor which we call Local Phase Quantisation from Three Orthogonal Planes (LPQ-TOP), and compare this with the Local Binary Patterns from Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP). The efficiency of these descriptors is evaluated by a fully automatic AU detection system and tested on posed and spontaneous expression data collected from the MMI and SEMAINE databases. Results show that the systems based on LPQ achieve higher accuracy rate than those using LBP, and that the systems that utilise dynamic appearance descriptors outperform those that use static appearance descriptors.

A coarse synchronization algorithm, often neglected in literature, is introduced by continuously correlating received samples' segments with a self-generated template until a simple threshold condition is satisfied. A proposed fine synchronization algorithm exploits the low sampling rates of the system and does not need to measure noise power, which helps reduce the receiver complexity (and power consumption). Finally, we assess, by simulation, the impact of different sampling rates and the synchronization lengths on bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the system.","2162-1020;21621020","","10.1109/ATC.2013.6698099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698099","","Distance measurement;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Noise;Receivers;Signal processing algorithms;Synchronization","analogue-digital conversion;radio receivers;synchronisation;telecommunication standards;ultra wideband technology","IEEE 802.15.4a UWB receivers;IEEE 802.15.4a standard;bit-error-rate performance;coarse synchronization algorithm;energy detection UWB noncoherent analog front-end;fine synchronization algorithm;integrate-and-dump ADC;low complexity receiver;noise power;power consumption;receiver complexity;self-generated template;square-law device;sub-Nyquist sampling rates;synchronization lengths;threshold condition;two-step synchronization algorithm","","0","","11","","","16-18 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) have a great potential for future high-frequency and high-power applications because of the intrinsic advantages of materials such as wide band gap, high breakdown voltage, and high electron peak velocity [2-4]. Si substrate is considered as a promising candidate to replace expensive and small wafers such as sapphire and SiC, even though the GaN layer grown on Si substrate has a large strain and dislocation due to a large lattice mismatch and thermal expansion coefficient difference between the grown GaN layer and the Si substrate. The mismatch between thermal expansion coefficients is about 56%, which induces a large tensile stress and may cause a severe crack generation in the grown GaN films during the cooling process after growth. In this work, for the purpose of reducing the crack density in the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure grown on Si substrate, we have grown dot-like AlSi<sub>x</sub>C<sub>1-x</sub> interlayer in initial growth state between AlN and Si substrate and demonstrated successful normally-on/off GaN HFET grown on silicon substrate.","","","10.1109/ISDRS.2011.6135301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6135301","","Aluminum gallium nitride;Gallium nitride;HEMTs;Logic gates;MODFETs;Silicon;Substrates","III-V semiconductors;aluminium compounds;gallium compounds;high electron mobility transistors;silicon;thermal expansion;wide band gap semiconductors","AlGaN-GaN;AlSi<sub>x</sub>C<sub>1-x</sub>;HFET;Si;breakdown voltage;cooling process;crack density reduction;crack generation;electron peak velocity;group III-nitride semiconductors;heterostructure field effect transistor;power electronic devices;short wavelength optoelectronics;size 4 inch;tensile stress;ternary solid solutions;thermal expansion coefficient difference;wide band gap","","0","","5","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SSVEP are brain responses synchronized with fast repetitive external visual stimuli. The SSVEP-BCI system is able to meet many of the requirements of a strict BCI, but still needs to reduce the influence of noise on the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal in order to improve its performance. In this paper, a novel SSVEP-BCI system is presented and analyzed in detail.

In this paper, the correlation of P2P overlay structure and quality of experience (QoE) is studied. Based on a large sample of flow data collected from operational network, we construct overlay topologies of four types of P2P application, i.e. BitTorrent, Thunder, UUSee and PPLive. By using complex network theory, structure properties of different P2P applications are analyzed from user's perspective, including reachability, PageRank distribution and connection maintenance capability.

Sisinni","Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy","IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","","2013","62","9","2538","2548","Wireless sensor networks are becoming widely diffused because of the flexibility and scalability they offer. However, distributed measurements are significant only if the readout is coupled to time information. For this reason, network-wide time synchronization is the main concern. The objective of this paper is to exploit a very simple hardware implementation of an IR-UWB radio for realizing an accurate synchronization system for wireless sensors. The proposed solution relies on commercial-off-the-shelf discrete electronic components (rather than on specialized transceivers). It is designed for providing accurate timestamping of the packet time of arrival (TOA) to an adder-based tunable clock, which tracks the network time reference. The comprehensive set of experimental results based on prototypes, shows a TOA detection error with a standard deviation well below 1 ns. On the other hand, in the FPGA-based prototype, the synchronization performance reaches an overall synchronization error of few nanoseconds. Finally, in order to highlight the tradeoff between timestamping accuracy, clock stability, and synchronization performance, some additional simulations have been carried out: a synchronization error in the order of 1 ns is possible, if good local oscillator sources are available in the nodes and if the adjustable clock has a sufficient resolution.","0018-9456;00189456","","10.1109/TIM.2013.2259101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6524047","Distributed systems;UWB systems;synchronization;wireless sensor network (WSN)","","adders;clocks;field programmable gate arrays;synchronisation;time-of-arrival estimation;ultra wideband communication;wireless sensor networks","FPGA-based prototype;IR-UWB radio;TOA detection error;adder-based tunable clock;clock stability;commercial-off-the-shelf discrete electronic components;low complexity UWB radios;network time reference;network-wide time synchronization;packet time-of-arrival;precise wireless sensor network synchronization;synchronization error;timestamping accuracy","","14","","51","","20130605","Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Nonlinear sideband effects in small-signal input dq admittance of six-pulse diode rectifiers","M. Jaksic; Z. Shen; I. Cvetkovic; D. Boroyevich; P. Mattavelli; M. Belkhayat; J. Verhulst","Center for Power Electronics Systems, The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, 652 Whittemore Hall, Blacksburg, 24061, USA","Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC), 2013 Twenty-Eighth Annual IEEE","","2013","","","2761","2768","This paper focuses on the modeling of small-signal input dq admittance of six-pulse diode rectifiers, providing comparison between well-known averaged value models (AVMs), the switching simulation model and hardware measurements. The analytical AVM (AAVM) is a widely used solution for modeling a six-pulse diode rectifier, but it is shown that it has to be modified in order to model the input dq admittance more accurately. Analytical expressions for all four admittances present in the dq matrix are derived and compared to switching model small-signal dq admittances. Furthermore, a parametric AVM (PAVM) is included into analysis, “slightly modified” and analytical expressions for all four dq admittances are derived in this case also. However, it is concluded that both AVMs predicts two admittances, Y<sub>dd</sub>(s) and Y<sub>qd</sub>(s), very precisely even beyond the switching frequency. On the other hand, the prediction of other two admittances, Y<sub>dq</sub>(s) and Y<sub>qq</sub>(s), is accurate only up to one fourth and one half of the switching frequency, respectively. The main sources of differences are found to be sideband resonant points that are mainly present in the response to q-channel injection. The main reason is that q-channel injection modulates commutation angle and yields significant sideband admittances around multiples of the switching frequency, which is typical behavior for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a hardware set-up is built, measured and modeled, showing that the switching simulation model captures nonlinear sideband effects accurately. In the end, a six-pulse diode rectifier feeding a constant power load is analyzed with the modified AAVM and through the detailed simulations of switching model, proving effectiveness of the proposed modifications. The nonlinear sidebands are inevitable phenomenon in a six-pulse diode rectifier as sidebands are found in all the presented test-cases.","1048-2334;10482334","","10.1109/APEC.2013.6520687","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6520687","","","commutation;diodes;electric admittance;load (electric);rectifiers","AAVM;PAVM;analytical AVM;averaged value model;commutation angle modulation;dq matrix;hardware measurement;nonlinear sideband effect;parametric AVM;q-channel injection;sideband admittance;sideband resonant point;six-pulse diode rectifier;small-signal input dq admittance;switching frequency;switching simulation model","","2","","12","","","17-21 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Rigid body modeling of three wheel vehicle to determine the dynamic stability — A practical approach","J. Sindha; B. Chakraborty; D. Chakravarty","","Transportation Electrification Conference (ITEC), 2015 IEEE International","","2015","","","1","8","The dynamic stability of a vehicle is of profound significance which has led three wheel vehicles to be used for only low speed application. Static Stability Factor (SSF) is a commonly used safety rating for vehicles. In this paper, stability of a three-wheeled vehicle with two wheels on the front (2F1R), a three-wheeled vehicle with two wheels on the rear (1F2R) and a standard four-wheeled vehicle are compared. A particularized formula for SSF of a three wheel vehicle is derived. Critical cornering conditions for lift-off are identified for both three wheeler configurations. Three wheelers with tilting wheel mechanism are seen as a potential solution for high speed stability. The mathematical model is derived for dynamic load transfer in case of tilting wheels. A comparison is carried out for cornering stability enhancements that can be achieved through tilting mechanism during critical cornering conditions. It is observed that SSF for a three wheel vehicle can be raised equivalent to that of a four wheel vehicle by implementing tilting mechanism. Difference in dynamic stability characteristics of 1F2R and 2F1R configurations are evaluated and presented in velocity vs. critical turning radius plots. Computation is required for operation of hydraulic cylinder of tilting mechanism. For this, a simple and practical approach is suggested in the paper. Rigid body analysis is performed to find the value of commonly used safety rating, SSF of a vehicle.","","","10.1109/ITEC-India.2015.7386889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7386889","Indian Auto;Static stability factor;Tilt angle;Tilting wheel mechanism","Force;Roads;Safety;Stability analysis;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles;Wheels","road vehicles;shapes (structures);shear modulus;stability;wheels","dynamic load transfer;hydraulic cylinder operation;lift-off;low speed application;static stability factor;three wheel vehicle dynamic stability;three wheel vehicle rigid body model;tilting wheel mechanism;vehicle safety","","","","14","","","27-29 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, limited work focuses on solving the bottleneck issue at the Zigbee coordinator in a data-intensive system to guarantee transmission reliability of life-critical data. This paper proposes coordinator traffic diffusion (CTD) method to redirect excessive traffic from coordinator to the sink in electrocardiography (ECG) medical application. CTD router, which implements CTD design, automatically redirects ECG data traffic to the sink node without involving the coordinator, and thus reliable real-time ECG monitoring service can be delivered precisely. CTD design is tested in both TI CC2530 Zigbee platform and NS2 simulation. Experimental result demonstrates that a CTD design can assist routers in successfully delivering real-time ECG data samples reliably with the best transmission rate, 24 kb/s.

A survey questionnaire of patient satisfaction showed that the long waiting time is the most dissatisfied service quality for healthcare providers. This study focused on improving clinical services by using collaborative approaches to reduce outpatient waiting time for the healthcare providers. The collaborative approaches are scheduling approach with results presented in this paper and agent-based collaborative control system which is currently in progress. We collected and observed data for two months from real world situation and used data from hospital database for building and validating simulation models. Seven scheduling scenarios are performed: scenarios I adjusted proportion between walk-in patients and scheduled patients, scenario II-VI adjusted patient sequencing, and scenario VII adjusted late rate and applied a late policy for late patients. The scenario I (adjusting the proportion: 10% for walk-in patients and 90% for scheduled patients) has the highest percentage of waiting time improvement (average: 37.13 % for walk-in patients and 50.82 % for scheduled patients) compared with the other scenarios.

An issue with current approaches is they are designed to be run sequentially and can be very computationally expensive. In this paper, ways of improving the performance of Sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization algorithms are introduced by utilizing distributed computing over a cluster of computers. The goal was to find ways of maximizing the throughput of a known algorithm without worrying about the accuracy of the algorithm itself (as this is shown through separate investigation). This was accomplished by testing out technologies such as MPI, POSIX threads and the OpenMP library.

The cost of this state increases as networks support ever more sophisticated per-flow routing, traffic engineering, and service chaining. Per-flow or per-path state at the switches can be eliminated by encoding each packet's desired path in its header. A key component of such a method is an efficient encoding of paths through the network. We introduce a mathematical formulation of this optimal path-encoding problem. We prove that the problem is APX-hard, by showing that approximating it to within a factor less than 8/7 is NP-hard. Thus, at best, we can hope for a constant-factor approximation algorithm. We then present such an algorithm, approximating the optimal path-encoding problem to within a factor 2.

Although such portable mobile devices can offer various promising applications, their computing resources remain limited due to their portable size. This however can be overcome by remotely executing computation-intensive tasks on clusters of near by computers known as cloudlets. As increasing numbers of people access the Internet via mobile devices, it is reasonable to envision in the near future that cloudlet services will be available for the public through easily accessible public wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs). However, the outdated notion of treating cloudlets as isolated data-centers-in-a-box must be discarded as there are clear benefits to connecting multiple cloudlets together to form a network. In this paper we investigate how to balance the workload between multiple cloudlets in a network to optimize mobile application performance. We first introduce a system model to capture the response times of offloaded tasks, and formulate a novel optimization problem, that is to find an optimal redirection of tasks between cloudlets such that the maximum of the average response times of tasks at cloudlets is minimized. We then propose a fast, scalable algorithm for the problem. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through experimental simulations. The experimental results demonstrate the significant potential of the proposed algorithm in reducing the response times of tasks.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9953-1; POD:978-1-4673-9954-8","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524411","","Cloud computing;Computers;Delays;Load management;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Time factors","Internet;cloud computing;metropolitan area networks;optimisation;radio networks","Internet;WMAN;average response times;cloudlet load balancing;cloudlet services;computation-intensive tasks;computing resources;optimal redirection;optimization problem;portable mobile devices;portable size;public wireless metropolitan area networks;scalable algorithm;wireless communication technology;wireless metropolitan area networks","","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fingernail sensor uses optical reflectance photoplethysmography to measure the change in blood perfusion in the fingernail bed where an array of LEDs and photodetectors is mounted on the fingernail surface, and the fingertip force is estimated on the basis of the photodetector outputs. In this paper, we conduct thorough experimental characterization of the sensitivity and efficiency of light transmittance through the fingernail bed to wavelength and optical path length.

For the wool and jeans materials, we consider both dry and wet conditions. The knowledge of dielectric constant of these materials is needed for evaluation of radar based concealed object detection methods. The measurement setup used consists mainly of a vector network analyzer (VNA) combined with two -band frequency extenders. A free space transmission only measurement technique is used to obtain both the complex dielectric constant and the effective thickness of all the fabric materials. Such approach is adequate for fabric materials as they do not have a well-defined thickness. The major factors affecting the uncertainty in the measurements are shown to be related to the sample thickness inhomogeneity, and to the unrepeatability of the network analyzer measurement itself.

We aim at developing a system capable of dealing with multiple moving sound sources. We will show that this is possible given that there are instances where there are only one dominating sound source. In the first step of the system we employ a feature detection and matching strategy. This produces TDOA data, possibly with missing data and with outliers. Then we use a robust and stratified approach for the parameter estimation.

In past lot of research on algorithms for QRS detection has been carried out. All such methods mostly rely on a priori knowledge of the shape of the QRS complexes and general aspects of the ECG. Most of approaches require more CPU time and involve complex mathematics which is difficult to implement for low cost, low power pacemaker design. Moreover, baseline shift, power line interference, muscle noise and other artifacts poses further bottleneck for accurate QRS detection. Detailed analysis of various approaches and their constraints for real time pacemaker application has been done in this paper. A simple, cost competitive smart design has also been proposed. Our solution has very low power requirement and achieves high QRS detection performance without compromising timing accuracy and reliability. To achieve improved QRS detection reliability, various noise components have been attenuated by clever implementation of optimized prefiltering in conjunction with a A/D conversion and Zero-crossing detection. Complete system proposed in this paper has been designed around a PIC microcontroller, Data Acquisition module and a display unit. Proposed design has been tested for extensive data collected from hospitals. Result achieved confirms the design approach illustrated.","","","10.1109/CSNT.2011.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5966480","ADC;ECG;PIC;QRS detection;ZCD","Algorithm design and analysis;Electrocardiography;Filtering;Microcontrollers;Monitoring;Real time systems;Transforms","analogue-digital conversion;data acquisition;electrocardiography;medical control systems;medical signal processing;microcontrollers;pacemakers","A-D conversion;ECG analysis;PIC microcontroller;baseline shift;data acquisition module;display unit;low cost QRS detection complex module;low power QRS detection complex module;muscle noise;optimized prefiltering;power line interference;real time pacemaker application;zero crossing detection","","0","","18","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Hidden Markov Model for Localization Using Low-End GSM Cell Phones","M. Ibrahim; M. Youssef","Wireless Intell. Networks Center (WINC), Nile Univ., Smart Village, Egypt","2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","","2011","","","1","5","Research in location determination for GSM phones has gained interest recently as it enables a wide set of location based services. RSSI-based techniques have been the preferred method for GSM localization on the handset as RSSI information is available in all cell phones. Although the GSM standard allows for a cell phone to receive signal strength information from up to seven cell towers, many of today's cell phones are low-end phones, with limited API support, that gives only information about the associated cell tower. In addition, in many places in the world, the density of cell towers is very small and therefore, the available cell tower information for localization is very limited. This raises the challenge of accurately determining the cell phone location with very limited information, mainly the RSSI of the associated cell tower. In this paper we propose a Hidden Markov Model based solution that leverages the signal strength history from only the associated cell tower to achieve accurate GSM localization. We discuss the challenges of implementing our system and present the details of our system and how it addresses the challenges. To evaluate our proposed system, we implemented it on Android-based phones. Results for two different testbeds, representing urban and rural environments, show that our system provides at least 156% enhancement in median error in rural areas and at least 68% enhancement in median error in urban areas compared to current RSSI-based GSM localization systems.","1550-3607;15503607","","10.1109/icc.2011.5962993","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962993","","Accuracy;Cellular phones;GSM;Global Positioning System;Hidden Markov models;Poles and towers;Urban areas","application program interfaces;cellular radio;hidden Markov models;mobile computing","API support;Android-based phones;GSM standard;RSSI information;RSSI-based GSM localization systems;RSSI-based techniques;associated cell tower;cell phone location;handset;hidden Markov model;location based services;location determination;low-end GSM cell phones;low-end phones;median error;receive signal strength information;signal strength history;tower information","","22","","15","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complete procedure is performed by two steps: the qualitative and the quantitative. The first step focuses on the analysis of three classes of properties, the electromagnetic environment, system function/structure, and their interactions. The primary BN model is built at the end of the first step. The second step investigates the BN nodes and branches one by one, which further implemented through two stages, i.e., the data acquisition and data fusion. The susceptibilities of devises are examined with the pulsed current injection. The responses of the transmission lines to HEMP are computed using the field-line coupling model. Comparing the probability density functions of the electromagnetic stresses and strengths produces the failure probabilities of the interface components. Through two-step analysis, the critical elements and coupling paths are identified and highlighted. After neglecting those unimportant factors, many BN nodes and branches are deleted. Thus, the complexity of assessment is reduced. By assigning the probability values to the simplified BN model, the system failure probability is calculated, which characterizes the system vulnerability against HEMP environment. The illustration validates the rationality and flexibility of the BN assessment methodology.","0018-9375;00189375","","10.1109/TEMC.2015.2502591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366591","Assessment;Bayesian networks (BNs);E3;EME;HEMP;IEMI;vulnerability","Computational modeling;Computers;Couplings;Electromagnetics;Environmental management;Microcontrollers;Stress","Bayes methods;data acquisition;electromagnetic pulse;fault trees;microcontrollers;sensor fusion","BN assessment methodology;BN nodes;Bayesian networks;EME;HEMP;data acquisition;data fusion;electromagnetic environment;electromagnetic stresses;failure probabilities;fault tree analysis;field-line coupling model;high-altitude electromagnetic pulse;microcontroller system;primary BN model;probability density functions;pulsed current injection;system failure probability;system-level vulnerability assessment;transmission line","","","","18","","20151225","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work, the operator palpates tissue containing tumors in a minimally invasive surgical (MIS) training box, representing the patient's body, through a master-slave teleoperation system which consists of a 7 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic interface, used as the master, and a Mitsubishi PA10-7C robot as the slave. Using the proposed method, the operator would be able to palpate the tissue consistently, observe the pressure distribution over the tissue by a color contour map on a screen and feel the tumor on his/her fingers through a grasping mechanism of the haptic interface as a result of higher stiffness of the tumor. The tissue used for the experiments was ex vivo bovine lung and seven participants were asked to locate artificial tumors embedded in the lungs.

In order to deliver substantially higher peak rates operators will need to deploy a much denser infrastructure and/or acquire more spectrum, thus significantly increasing their CAPEX and OPEX and reducing revenues. To improve the utilization of available network resources this paper presents ActiveCast, a disruptive content delivery paradigm that supports opportunistic content pre-fetching by introducing semantic and context awareness in the currently “agnostic” networking paradigm. The experimental investigations presented in the paper focus on mobile video provision and a content provider, integrated with Facebook and YouTube, has been developed and used to identify socially relevant content for a set of test users. Part of the studies presented in the paper aim at experimentally understanding the structure of the energy costs associated with pre-fetching and on defining a delivery strategy that allows controlling the amount of energy invested. A comparison between a centralized implementation, in which pre-fetching is coordinated by the mobile operators, and an Over-The-Top (OTT) implementation of ActiveCast are also presented. The results show that complementing the context information available at individual user terminals with traffic information, shared by mobile operators through the ActiveCast API, can substantially reduce the energy costs of content delivery, as compared with “on demand” video streaming. Additionally, opportunistically exploiting connections with WiFi APs can amplify the gains already achievable by prefetching on wide area networks.","1525-3511;15253511","","10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555309","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6555309","","Context;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Servers;Streaming media;YouTube","mobile radio;telecommunication traffic;ubiquitous computing;wide area networks","ActiveCast API;CAPEX;Facebook;OPEX;WiFi AP;YouTube;context-aware content prefetching;disruptive content delivery paradigm;mobile network;mobile video provision;opportunistic content prefetching;traffic requirement;wide area network","","2","","13","","","7-10 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore a comparative analysis for the power consumption and cost saving performance is carried out to show the benefit of using renewable energy sources along with a fuzzy logic based load controller.

The joint problem is modeled as a Stackelberg game. As the leader, the macrocell keeps silent on some channels for reducing interference to motivate the small cells to adapt macro users. As the followers, the small cells operate with biasing to accommodate macro users. Meanwhile, both the macrocell and small cells optimally allocate the transmit power over channels.

The central hypothesis is that these patterns, which can be explained in terms of invariants inherent to the closed-loop dynamics, provide the building blocks for the organization of human guidance behavior. The concept of interaction patterns is first introduced using a toy example and then detailed formally using dynamical system and control principles. This paper then demonstrates the existence and significance of interaction patterns in human guidance behavior that is based on data collected using guidance experiments with a miniature helicopter. The results confirm that human guidance behavior indeed exhibits invariances as defined by interaction patterns. The trajectories that are associated with each interaction pattern are then further decomposed by applying piecewise linear identification. The resulting elements are then combined under a hierarchical model that provides a natural and formal description of human guidance behavior.","2168-2291;21682291","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2262043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6548027","Biological control system;control system;dynamics;formal language;human factors","Behavioral science;Biological system modeling;Control systems;Human factors;Natural language processing;Pattern recognition","behavioural sciences;multi-agent systems","agent-environment interaction;closed-loop agent-environment dynamics;control principle;dynamical system;guidance experiment;hierarchical model;human guidance behavior analysis;human guidance behavior modeling;interaction patterns concept;miniature helicopter","","7","","37","","","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In portable consumer products, while chip stacking via the system in package (SiP) approach is becoming quite popular, the use of conventional packaging techniques is complicated, and results in large parasitic inductances. The need for planarity, additional processing steps, and high temperature processing, make bumping and flip chip bonding a less than ideal solution. These challenges and the need to eliminate lead-based solders and halogen containing substrate materials have renewed the industry's interest in exploring newer assembly methods at both the component packaging and lead-free PCB assembly levels, especially by using conductive adhesives. Conductive adhesives can be typically processed at a relatively low temperature which is important for thermally sensitive components.

The proposed transducer is a tapered hybrid plasmon-dielectric waveguide that typically consists of two hybrid plasmon modes. Along the taper, one of the hybrid modes approaches cutoff, while the other approaches the short-range surface plasmon mode that couples optical energy well into the recording medium over a nanospot size of 28 nm by 38 nm, owing to its relatively uniform and strong longitudinal field component. The power coupled into the SRSP mode, at the transducer input, is about 62% and this efficiency is preserved well along the length. This power in turn couples well into the recording medium with a maximum absorption efficiency of 7.87%. The absorption efficiency is relatively broadband. Even with the inclusion of a magnetic pole 30 nm away from the transducer, the maximum absorption efficiency is 6.44%. The proposed structure is tolerant to fabrication misalignments, since the metallic, gap and dielectric layers are all self-aligned. The high-efficiency, broadband nature and ease of fabrication, makes the proposed transducer highly suitable for HAMR applications, and possibly nanofocusing applications.","0733-8724;07338724","","10.1109/JLT.2014.2335741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6851152","Magnetic recording;nanofocusing;plasmonic","Absorption;Gold;Magnetic recording;Optical waveguides;Plasmons;Transducers","magnetic recording;nanophotonics;optical waveguides;plasmonics;surface plasmons;transducers","dielectric waveguide mode;heat-assisted magnetic recording;maximum absorption efficiency;nanoscale optical energy transfer;near-field plasmonic transducer;short-range surface plasmon mode;tapered hybrid plasmon-dielectric waveguide","","3","","21","","20140709","Sept.1, 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In practice it is non-trivial, time-consuming and costly to get the configuration right. We describe the development of a configuration agent that can automate some of these system administration activities while ensuring that the server is correctly configured and available. The agent is used by individual XMPP servers to (autonomically) configure when and how they should federate to provide end-to-end services.

We introduce defect probability, which is the probability that a lithography defect occurs if the margins between two adjacent cells are missing. Computing the defect probability of all cell pairs is impractical due to lengthy lithography simulations and huge number of cell pair combinations. Two approximate methods are employed to make this computation possible: reducing the range of optical proximity correction and grouping cell pairs of similar geometry at the cell boundary. We also present how the cell layout can be modified for a lower defect probability with no impact on the cell electrical parameters. Defect probability is applied to two physical design optimization problems. In the automatic placement, we consider that all cells are initially without margins. We want to locate two cells adjacent if their defect probability is zero (or negligibly small) or insert margins in between; this is achieved using the average defect probability as one of the cost terms of the placement. Experiments in 28-nm commercial library demonstrate an 8% reduction in the area with a 4% shorter wirelength. In the second application, we assume that the standard placement using cells with margins have been performed. We want to identify redundant margins that can be removed while the defect probability is kept zero. We take a step forward and shuffle the location of a few consecutive cells in the same row so that more redundant margins are identified. Once all the redundant margins are removed, newly created whitespace is distributed to reduce routing congestion in highly congested areas. Experiments indicate a 48% reduction in the number of overflow routing grids.","1063-8210;10638210","","10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2572224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7486964","Defect probability;intercell margin;lithography defect;physical design;placement;post-placement optimization.","Geometry;Layout;Lithography;Metals;Optimization;Physical design;Standards","","","","","","","","20160608","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

While multicore technology has become the norm of modern computers, programming such systems requires the understanding of underlying hardware architecture and hence posts a great challenge for average joe programmers, who might be professionals in specific domains, but not experts in parallel programming. This paper presents a GUI tool called CUDA Block that can facilitate parallel programming on multicore computer systems. CUDA Block is developed based on the Open Blocks framework, an extendable tool for graphical programming, to construct the GUI-based programming environment for CUDA parallel computing platform. Programmers simply need to drag-n-drop blocks, fill the fields of the blocks, and connect them according to array or matrix computations that are specified by algorithms. CUDA Block can then export block-based code to CUDA programs. Furthermore, a couple of optimization constructs have also been also offered for rapid program optimization. Preliminary experimental results have shown that the generated CUDA programs can achieve reasonable speedups on GPUs. Consequently, CUDA Block can be used as a tool for fast prototyping of GPU applications or a platform for education of parallel programming.","1530-2016;15302016","","10.1109/ICPPW.2015.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349891","CUDA;GPGPU;GUI;heterogeneous computing;programming tool","Arrays;Graphics processing units;Kernel;Optimization;Programming profession;Visualization","computer science education;graphical user interfaces;graphics processing units;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;parallel programming;software tools","CUDABlock;GPU;GUI programming tool;Open Blocks framework;graphics processing unit;multicore computer system;parallel programming education;program optimization","","","","11","","","1-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

QD analysis is a form of multivariate statistical analysis that can be applied to forecasting seasonal sea ice freeze-up and break-up. The forecast problem is formulated as a classification problem, with two classes (e.g., ""ice"" and ""no ice"") and the objective of the analysis is to decide which of the classes best describes the ice/no ice condition at a particular geographic point on a specified date. We have conducted experiments to measure the performance of the GPU with respect to the serial CPU, parallel CPU (OpenMP), MATLAB, MATLAB (Parallel for) implementations. The experiments consist of implementing a serial CPU, parallel CPU (OpenMP), MATLAB, MATLAB (Parallel for) and GPU versions of the QD analysis algorithm and executing all versions on several data sets to compare the performance.

Digital images are often superimposed by noises at the acquisition stage depending upon the availability of lighting. Image denoising is a key technology to reduce the noise levels from the images while preserving the fine details and structures. Predominantly, conventional Bilateral filter is employed, providing better noise reduction capabilities with low noise density while preserving the edges. The spatial processing of pixels is reckoned by using a Gaussian function (symmetric and smoothly decaying function). This paper introduces a Bilateral filter which incorporates a Rayleigh distribution function in its domain filter to smoothen out the image pairs more effectively. This filter has been implemented on both the images (flash and no-flash) in the present work. Simulations are carried out on the images contaminated with different levels of Gaussian noise and are evaluated on the basis of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) as image quality parameters. Performance of the proposed filter has shown significant results when compared to the conventional Bilateral filter.","","","10.1109/SPIN.2015.7095418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7095418","Bilateral filter;Flash image;Image denoising;No-flash image;PSNR","Adaptive filters;Filtering;Filtering algorithms;Image edge detection;Noise reduction;PSNR","Gaussian processes;digital photography;edge detection;image denoising;smoothing methods","Gaussian function;Gaussian noise;PSNR;Rayleigh distribution function;Rayleigh-based bilateral filtering;SSIM;acquisition stage;conventional Bilateral filter;digital images;digital photography;domain filter;edge preservation;fine detail preservation;flash-no-flash image pairs;image denoising;image pair smoothing;image quality parameters;lighting availability;low-noise density;noise level reduction;noise reduction capability;peak signal-to-noise ratio;pixel spatial processing;smoothly-decaying function;structural similarity;structure preservation;symmetric function","","0","","36","","","19-20 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Epoxy resin has been used as sealing material for semiconductor devices. Recently, a new semiconductor like silicon carbide (SiC) has been developed to use it at high temperature environment. However, the conventional epoxy resin is unable to be used at such high temperature. Therefore, a thermal property of the epoxy resin must be improved to use it for the device. To improve it, at first, it is necessary to understand the insulating property of the conventional epoxy resin in high temperature environment. On the other hand, it is said that a space charge accumulation in some insulating materials under high DC electric field sometimes causes a dielectric breakdown. Therefore, we tried to investigate the relationship between the space charge accumulation and the breakdown in the conventional epoxy resin under high DC stress at high temperature. A time dependent space charge distribution was observed using the PEA method. Furthermore, since the devices are used in a severe condition at high temperature with high humidity, we also tried to study the effects of a heat treatment, a humidification and drying treatment on the space charge formation in the epoxy resin. Judging from the results, it was found that a moisture content in the bulk of the epoxy resin strongly affected the space charge accumulation under dc high stress. Furthermore, it was found that the moisture content also affected the breakdown property.","0084-9162;00849162","","10.1109/CEIDP.2014.6995823","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6995823","","Annealing;Charge measurement;Electric fields;Epoxy resins;Space charge;Stress;Time measurement","drying;epoxy insulation;heat treatment;moisture;resins;sealing materials;semiconductor device breakdown;space charge","PEA method;dielectric breakdown;drying treatment;epoxy resin insulating property;epoxy resin moisture content;epoxy resin thermal property;heat treatment effect;high DC electric field;high DC stress;high humidity;high temperature environment;humidification treatment;insulating material;pulsed-electro acoustic method;sealing material;semiconductor device;space charge accumulation;time dependent space charge distribution","","0","","4","","","19-22 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Timing resolution is 10ps in the present prototype, and approximately +/-20ps accuracy is achieved, including ~6sigma random jitter. The use of multiple, overlapping delay generators assures that no ""dead"" times are encountered, and enables extremely complex waveforms to be synthesized as needed. In addition to producing the precise timing edges, the circuit allows for format switching on any edge (NRZ, RZ, R1, RC) and also handles the parallel-to-serial conversion of test pattern data (from 16-bit parallel at 200MWps to 3.2Gbps serial). The TGFC is intended to be integrated as part of future digital or mixed-signal ATE. The prototype was developed and optimized to support an Fmax of 3.2Gbps as a demonstration.

Through developing of a crosstalk avoidance code (CAC) is possible to create a forbidden transition channel (FTC) that prevents transitions responsible for generating crosstalk, [2]. Rules used in developing a CAC can be very complex, and because of that in some papers is explained only the coding algorithm without given a description of the coder/decoder (CODEC). Some of the CAC presented in literature can have only a theoretical point of view, the physical implementation raising problems regarding the real time execution requirements of such a system [3].

Recently, the identification/locator (ID/Locator) split architecture has demonstrated its significant predominance in next generation mobile networks. With the aim of pushing the global deployment of mobility support over IPv6, this study makes an effort to design and evaluate an operational mobility model over IPv6 (OMIPv6) based on ID/Locator split architecture. Instead of the home agents adopted in the standard MIPv6, a cloud mobility management center is employed to be responsible for maintaining the identification and locations of mobile hosts, as well as providing the name resolution services to the mobile hosts.

This can be a result of lack of experiences to control re-occurrence and prevent new risks according to the previous projects experience. On the other hand, Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) are known concepts for learning from experiences to avoid non-conformities. The successful implementations of CAPA in different systems have convinced the authors to use CAPA in Risk Assessment Process to decrease the likelihood and impact of risks by learning from the past. To achieve this, our application should survey and rank the possibility and effect of risks, as well as their related elements (such as assets, threats, safeguards, vulnerabilities and team accountability). After each appearance of a risk, the system should review and correct the ranks. It must perform a Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Another requirement for the system is to be able to find similar items. The system can distinguish the similarities by categorizing risk related elements according to their properties and finding possible comparable substances. In addition, this system also uses its data to produce useful high level recommendations and other required documents. By applying this model and after identifying all weaknesses, the value of risks abates dramatically. This Corrective Action and Preventive Actions in Risk Assessment (CAPRA) has been successfully designed and implemented as a web based application.","","","10.1109/ICOS.2011.6079271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6079271","CAPA;Corrective Action;Preventive Action;Risk Assessment","Companies;Conferences;Documentation;Engines;ISO standards;Open systems;Risk management","risk management;software development management","CAPRA;RCA;corrective action and preventive actions in risk assessment;risk assessment software;root cause analysis","","0","","10","","","25-28 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the runtime partial reconfiguration potentials of the latest FPGA devices along with the availability of unused programmable resources in most FPGA designs provide interesting opportunities to build fault tolerant mechanisms. In this paper, we exploit the latest dynamic reconfiguration advances and propose a fault-tolerant FPGA processor architecture based on runtime reconfigurable modules. We partition the processor core into reconfigurable modules and duplicate these modules to implement a concurrent error detection mechanism. For every duplicated module we generate precompiled configurations which include spare resources and are used to runtime repair the defective module. The processor freezes upon the detection of an error and an on-chip controller coordinates the processor recovery and repair in a reconfiguration process transparent to the processor.

Indeed, magnetotaxis inherent in MTB can be exploited to direct them towards a tumor while being propelled by their own flagellated molecular motors. Nonetheless, although the thrust propelling force above 4 pN of the MC-1 MTB showed to be superior compared to other technologies for displacement in the microvasculature, MTB becomes much less efficient when travelling in larger blood vessels due to higher blood flow. In the latter case, a new technique developed by our group and referred to as Magnetic Resonance Navigation (MRN), has been successfully applied in larger vessels using synthetic microcarriers nut proved to be less efficient in the microvasculature due mainly to technological constraints. These findings called for the need to integrate both approaches by encapsulating MTB in special MRN-compatible microcarriers to be release in the vicinity of microvascular networks where they becomes more effective for targeting purposes in tumoral lesions.

We also investigated the relationship between presence in a virtual environment and pain intensity. 30 students of Wroclaw University participated in the within subject experiment. The participants were looking at the game through head mounted displays. In two experimental conditions a participant navigated the game using a computer mouse (a small movement), or a Microsoft Kinect (a large movement). Thermal (cold) stimulation was used to inflict pain. While playing the game, the participants immersed their non-dominant hands in a container with cold water (temperature 0.5 - 1.5°C). Two measures were used to assess the pain experience -- the amount of time the participants spent keeping their hands in cold water (pain tolerance), and Visual Analogue Scale (pain intensity). The participants also completed the I group Presence Questionnaire (IPQ), measuring the sense of presence experienced in a virtual environment. The predictions were partly confirmed by the results -- the participants were keeping their hands in cold water significantly longer in the large movement condition compared to the small movement condition. However, there was no significant difference on pain intensity results between the two experimental conditions. Similarly, we failed to find any correlations between IPQ dimensions and the pain measures used in the study.

Cloud computing is an efficient choice to execute these large-scale screenings, given that large compute allocations are not accessible to many researchers. This research focused on developing a multi-site cloud environment that combines small allocations of virtual machines in multiple locations connected through a virtual networking system (ViNe), and compared two parallelization approaches: Message Passing Interface (MPI) and MapReduce using Hadoop. Virtual screenings were conducted using DOCK, a protein-ligand molecular interaction simulation program. Multiple DOCK test simulations through MPI and Hadoop were run to assess the performance and flexibility of the environment. These tests indicated that MPI and MapReduce offer comparable scalability performance, and that network latency has a significant influence on low accuracy simulations. Furthermore, differences in performance at individual cloud resource sites were reduced on average because of the larger combined pool of resources. This project prototyped and assessed a fully functional multi-site cloud environment for virtual screenings, which can be used to guide small laboratories in deploying their own cloud-based screenings.","","","10.1109/eScience.2015.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7304285","Computational biochemistry;Hadoop;MPI;cloud computing;distributed computing","Cloud computing;Compounds;Databases;Pricing;Proteins;Virtual machining","biochemistry;cloud computing;message passing;virtual machines","Hadoop;MPI;MapReduce;ViNe;cloud-based screenings;fully functional multisite cloud environment;message passing interface;molecular simulations;molecular virtual screenings;multisite cloud environment;virtual machines;virtual networking system;virtual screenings","","","","30","","","Aug. 31 2015-Sept. 4 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Langer","","From X-rays to DNA:How Engineering Drives Biology","","2013","","","","","Engineering has been an essential collaborator in biological research and breakthroughs in biology are often enabled by technological advances. Decoding the double helix structure of DNA, for example, only became possible after significant advances in such technologies as X-ray diffraction and gel electrophoresis. Diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis improved as new technologies -- including the stethoscope, the microscope, and the X-ray -- developed. These engineering breakthroughs take place away from the biology lab, and many years may elapse before the technology becomes available to biologists. In this book, David Lee argues for concurrent engineering -- the convergence of engineering and biological research -- as a means to accelerate the pace of biological discovery and its application to diagnosis and treatment. He presents extensive case studies and introduces a metric to measure the time between technological development and biological discovery.Investigating a series of major biological discoveries that range from pasteurization to electron microscopy, Lee finds that it took an average of forty years for the necessary technology to become available for laboratory use. Lee calls for new approaches to research and funding to encourage a tighter, more collaborative coupling of engineering and biology. Only then, he argues, will we see the rapid advances in the life sciences that are critically needed for life-saving diagnosis and treatment.","","97802623183","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6670280.pdf&bkn=6670254&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","2013","","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

The various traffic control needs can be satisfied to adapt to different traffic conditions by adjusting the red wave weighting factor in the objective function. The optimal solution of the model can be achieved by use of LINGO software and programming language. Finally, the example effectively demonstrates that the model can maximize the bandwidths of green wave and red wave for different directions and obtain precise timing schemes with a strong scientific rationality.","","","10.1109/ICMT.2011.6003197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6003197","green wave;mixed-integer linear programming;red wave;time-space diagram;traffic engineering","Adaptation models;Bandwidth;Cities and towns;Green products;Mixed integer linear programming;Roads","integer programming;linear programming;programming languages;road traffic","LINGO software;arterial road;flow-sharing strategy;green wave coordinated control model;mixed integer linear programming model;programming language;red wave coordinated control model;road traffic congestion;time-space analysis method;traffic demand;traffic management strategy","","1","","11","","","26-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some applications concerning circulate plates vibrating at the thickness-shear mode or the shear effects are analyzed by transforming the relatively simple equations of the thickness-shear and flexural modes to the cylindrical coordinates with a simple procedure, as we can find from a few papers and books. The systematic derivation by following a rigorous procedure of Mindlin plate equations are not presented before, and subsequent applications to coupled vibrations of circular plates at thickness-shear modes have not be studied with the Mindlin plate equations for circular type quartz crystal resonators.

IMGs consist of many factories with distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric loads that heavily rely on combined heat and power systems. This study illustrates that UC in an IMG is not solely a profit-based UC or a security constrained UC (SCUC) problem. Therefore a new profit-based SCUC (PB-SCUC) formulation is proposed for IMGs that includes both microgrid (MG) security and factories constraints while utilising the generators waste heat to fulfill thermal requirements. The MG controller will solve the PB-SCUC problem to minimise the final production cost through maximisation of the profit by selling electricity to the upstream network. As each DER and boiler may have an individual owner, an approach based on game theory is also implemented to fairly allocate cost saving among factories participating in the generation process. Detailed simulation results are presented for an IMG consisting of 12 factories and analysed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","1751-8822;17518822","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650285","","","distributed power generation;game theory;industrial power systems;power system economics;power system measurement;power system simulation;profitability","cost saving;distributed energy resources;electric loads;fair allocation;game theory;industrial microgrids;profit-based unit commitment;security constrained UC problem;security constraints","","0","","","","","Nov. 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Sixteen parallel digital data are generally required to operate all the four 16:1 analog multiplexers switching at the same time. In this paper the surface electrode switching of a 16-electrode EIT system is studied using 8-bit parallel digital data. 8-bit parallel digital data are generated using a USB based data acquisition system (DAS) and a binary adder circuit (BAC) is used to convert it to the 16-bit digital data required for surface electrode switching of a 16-electrode EIT system. An automatic ESM is developed with four 16:1 analog multiplexers connected to sixteen surface electrodes. 8-bit parallel digital bits are generated using NI USB 6251 card using LabVIEW software and sent to the BAC which converts it into a 16-bit parallel digital data. BAC feeds the 16-bit digital data to the multiplexers in ESM and operates them to switch the surface electrodes. 1 mA, 50 kHz sinusoidal constant current is injected at the practical phantoms and the boundary potentials are collected. Resistivity images are reconstructed from the boundary data using EIDORS. Boundary data and reconstructed images are studied with contrast parameters to assess the electrode switching of the EIT system. Results show that the resistivity images of practical phantoms are successfully reconstructed from the boundary data collected with 8-bit parallel digital data sets.","","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141434","16-bit parallel digital data;8-bit parallel digital data;EIDORS;EIT;boundary potential;electrical impedance tomography;image reconstruction;practical phantom;surface electrode switching","Electric potential;Electrodes;Image reconstruction;Nonhomogeneous media;Phantoms;Switches;Tomography","adders;data acquisition;electric impedance imaging;electrodes;image reconstruction;phantoms","16-electrode EIT system;EIDORS;LabVIEW software;NI USB 6251 card;USB based data acquisition system;analog multiplexers;automatic electrode switching module;binary adder circuit;boundary data;boundary potentials;current 1 mA;frequency 50 kHz;parallel digital data;phantoms;reconstructed images;resistivity images;sinusoidal constant current;surface electrode array;surface electrode switching;word length 8 bit","","2","","19","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If supercapacitors are employed together with the FC as energy storage systems, they can make up for the temporary lack of energy produced by the FC. However, the steep slopes of the voltage dips affect the energy that can be actually delivered by the supercapacitor because of the frequency dependence of its capacitance, and this should be taken into account in sizing the supercapacitor. In this paper, the supercapacitor response to a FC voltage dip is simulated and discussed, based on an experimentally identified supercapacitor model and a typical voltage dip measured on a single PEM FC.","","","10.1109/AMPS.2015.7312740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312740","","Capacitance;Fuel cells;Humidity;Supercapacitors;Voltage fluctuations;Voltage measurement","energy storage;fuel cell power plants;hybrid power systems;porous materials;proton exchange membrane fuel cells;supercapacitors","PEM fuel cell system;energy storage systems;fast fuel cell energy dips;gas channel flooding;hybrid supercapacitor;porous layers;supercapacitor model;voltage dips","","","","19","","","23-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, the modeling of human behaviors based on those data becomes very important due to the increasing popularity of context-aware computing and people-centric applications, which utilize users' behavior pattern to improve the existing services or enable new services. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Mobile Behaviometrics, to measure and quantify unique human behavioral patterns and natural rhythm that every user has when interacting with their mobile devices. After empirically study the similarity between human behavior and natural language, we introduce a language approach using well established natural language process (NLP) techniques: we convert the raw sensory data into behavior text representation as sequences of behavior labels. Each behavior label is considered as a word in the language. We then train n-gram language model on those traces based on which we are able to perform classification, prediction and anomaly detection. We apply these Behaviometric models and algorithms to several practical use scenarios. From the experimental results, we conclude that we are able to efficiently model and identify users via Behaviometrics analysis of the sensory data using the proposed techniques.","2377-8644;23778644","","10.1109/ICCChina.2013.6671100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671100","","Context;Context modeling;Data models;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Natural languages;Sensors","behavioural sciences computing;human computer interaction;human factors;mobile computing;natural language processing;text analysis;user interfaces","NLP;behavior label sequences;behavior text representation;context-aware computing;embedded sensors;human behavior modeling;mobile behaviometrics;mobile devices;natural language process techniques;people-centric applications;physical context;unique human behavioral pattern measurement;unique human behavioral pattern quantification;virtual context","","1","","18","","","12-14 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, power generation cost of the WECS is still higher than that of fossil energy conversion systems. Therefore, new type generators and power electronic drive circuits are required to be developed. A Permanent Magnet Reluctance Generator (PMRG), which is a special Switched Reluctance Generator (SRG) with magnet on stator yoke, seems to have potential to meet expectations of WECSs. Although an Asymmetric Half Bridge (AHB) converter is the best solution for independent phase control of the PMRG, it contains six controllable switches and six freewheeling diodes. Another converter topology, known as Miller converter, requires less switches and diodes and can be used to reduce the converter cost. In this work, the first use of Miller converter for SRGs, particularly for PMRGs, has been presented. The converter has been accompanied by torque ripple minimization -assisted Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPTT) algorithm and has been experimentally performed on the PMRG driven WECS. The control-converter combination not only allows converting wind energy at its maximum power point (MPP) but also provides a protection from possible damages or failures due to torque ripples.","","","10.1109/ICEMS.2013.6754458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754458","","Assembly;Generators;Magnetic circuits;Rotors;Torque;Vibrations;Wind power generation","direct energy conversion;maximum power point trackers;permanent magnet generators;reluctance generators","AHB converter;MPTT algorithm;PMRG;SRG;WECS;asymmetric half bridge converter;fossil energy conversion systems;maximum power point tracking algorithm;miller converter;permanent magnet reluctance generator;power electronic drive circuits;stator yoke;switched reluctance generator;torque ripple minimization;wind energy conversion system","","0","","11","","","26-29 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"MemZip: Exploring unconventional benefits from memory compression","A. Shafiee; M. Taassori; R. Balasubramonian; A. Davis","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA","2014 IEEE 20th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA)","","2014","","","638","649","Memory compression has been proposed and deployed in the past to grow the capacity of a memory system and reduce page fault rates. Compression also has secondary benefits: it can reduce energy and bandwidth demands. However, most prior mechanisms have been designed to focus on the capacity metric and few prior works have attempted to explicitly reduce energy or bandwidth. Further, mechanisms that focus on the capacity metric also require complex logic to locate the requested data in memory. In this paper, we design a highly simple compressed memory architecture that does not target the capacity metric. Instead, it focuses on complexity, energy, bandwidth, and reliability. It relies on rank subsetting and a careful placement of compressed data and metadata to achieve these benefits. Further, the space made available via compression is used to boost other metrics - the space can be used to implement stronger error correction codes or energy-efficient data encodings. The best performing MemZip configuration yields a 45% performance improvement and 57% memory energy reduction, compared to an uncompressed non-sub-ranked baseline. Another energy-optimized configuration yields a 29.8% performance improvement and a 79% memory energy reduction, relative to the same baseline.","1530-0897;15300897","","10.1109/HPCA.2014.6835972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835972","","Bandwidth;DRAM chips;Delays;Encoding;Memory management;Reliability","data compression;error correction codes;memory architecture;meta data","MemZip configuration;bandwidth demands;capacity metric;complex logic;compressed data;compressed memory architecture;energy reduction;energy-efficient data encodings;energy-optimized configuration;error correction codes;memory compression;memory system;metadata;page fault rate reduction;rank subsetting;uncompressed nonsubranked baseline;unconventional benefits","","17","","40","","","15-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though there exist intensive research activities for in-flight, tactical trajectory coordination, relatively little work has been done on strategic pre-departure trajectory coordination. Herein, we focus on oceanic pre-departure coordination where there is often sufficient time in FAA controlled airspace to make adjustments to trajectories and smaller portions of the flight occur in the domestic environment where strategic trajectory coordination may be further away. The strategic nature of this coordination considers the potential contention along the entire flight time, accommodating random departure delay and planned changes through the pre-departure four-dimensional (4D) stochastic trajectory model. A series of capabilities will be required to allow a negotiation of flight profiles. The existing capability, the Dynamic Oceanic Track System Plus (DOTS Plus), only de-conflicts trajectory conflicts at the oceanic entry points without explicitly addressing the conflicts between aircraft trajectories beyond the oceanic entry points. We explore levels of coordination with enhanced insight for both the Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) and the airspace user. Based on the pre-departure 4D stochastic models previously developed, this paper aims to propose a framework and algorithms for storing data for congestion depiction, for creating a pre-departure plan, and for alerting users when a change in situation allows a previously denied request to be satisfied. Each of these capabilities takes into account potential contention and induced cost along the entire flight time of each individual trajectory.","2155-4943;21554943","","10.1109/ICNSurv.2012.6218408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218408","","Aircraft;Data structures;Delay;Probabilistic logic;Software;Stochastic processes;Trajectory","aircraft control;stochastic processes;trajectory control","ANSP;Air Navigation Service Provider;DOTS Plus;Dynamic Oceanic Track System Plus;FAA controlled airspace;TBO;aircraft trajectory;congestion depiction;oceanic predeparture coordination;predeparture 4D stochastic model;predeparture four-dimensional;random departure delay;stochastic trajectory modeling;strategic predeparture trajectory coordination;strategic trajectory coordination;tactical trajectory coordination;trajectory based operation","","0","","6","","","24-26 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the physical mechanisms behind this current increase have been studied in both nanoribbon and planar devices with atomic-layer deposited Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> passivation. Increased tensile stress in the AlGaN layer due to passivation leads to an increase in the charge density in nanoribbon devices. Simultaneously, the mobility in nanoribbons increases after Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> passivation. These effects lead to a large (~118%) increase in the saturation drain current in nanoribbon devices. In contrast, fixed positive charge at the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-AlGaN interface leads to a small (~6%) saturation drain current increase in planar devices. In addition, the mechanisms behind the increase in the OFF-state drain current in the passivated devices are investigated. Schottky barrier lowering and the increase in surface and buffer conduction are found to be the major causes for the OFF-state current increase with passivation.","0018-9383;00189383","","10.1109/TED.2015.2500159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346477","Atomic-layer deposition (ALD);gallium nitride (GaN);nanoribbon;passivation;passivation.","Aluminum gallium nitride;Aluminum oxide;Current measurement;Logic gates;Nanoscale devices;Passivation","III-V semiconductors;Schottky barriers;aluminium compounds;atomic layer deposition;gallium compounds;high electron mobility transistors;nanoribbons;passivation;wide band gap semiconductors","Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>;AlGaN-GaN;Schottky barrier lowering;atomic-layer deposited passivation;charge density;nanoribbon high-electron-mobility transistors;planar devices;saturation drain current;tensile stress","","","","28","","20151203","Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, stacking faults form as a result of the 19.7% lattice mismatch at the 3CSiC/Si interface, and then propagate during epitaxial growth along four equivalent planes. After epitaxial growth has concluded, the presence of the stacking faults causes an intrinsic stress in the system that allows for the carbon-core partial dislocations to deviate in specific directions from their current plane, thus producing crowd lines of point defects as a result of forest dislocation formations, which are believed to be the main cause of high leakage current density in 3C-SiC. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to model the formation, propagation, and expansion of stacking faults, as well as the generation of the forest dislocations. The numerical analysis allows for a clear picture of the density of the forest dislocations throughout the system as a function of the stacking fault density and material thickness. In addition, the study predicts the orientations along which the forest dislocations will most likely form. Further analysis of the mechanisms by which forest dislocations form and the leakage current occurs will lead to more sophisticated fabrication processes of 3C-SiC.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8559-6; POD:978-1-4673-8560-2","10.1109/URTC.2015.7563749","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7563749","3C-SiC;forest dislocations;stacking faults","Crystals;Epitaxial growth;Leakage currents;Radiation detectors;Stacking;Stress;Transistors","Monte Carlo methods;elemental semiconductors;epitaxial growth;semiconductor growth;silicon;silicon compounds;slip;stacking faults;wide band gap semiconductors","3C-SiC(001);3CSiC-Si interface;Monte Carlo simulations;SiC-Si;carbon-core partial dislocations;crowd lines;epitaxial growth;equivalent planes;forest dislocation formations;gliding dislocations;intrinsic stress;lattice mismatch;leakage current density;point defects;stacking faults","","","","","","","7-8 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Subsequently, the system cannot predict the channel exactly and will suffer from performance loss. In this paper, an interference cancellation and coordination scheme is presented. This new scheme, by taking MMSCS resources and channel conditions into account, can improve SRS performance after reducing and avoiding interference. One aspect of the presented method is interference cancellation scheme which comprises resending scheme for inter-beam interference and orthogonality enhancement scheme for intra-beam interference. Another aspect is interference coordination scheme, which carries out short SRS hopping between users and acquires the full bandwidth information by several detections.

Early investment in fibre to the home gives our modern Swiss information and knowledge society a unique opportunity to increase the attractiveness of Switzerland as a business location. In order to connect Swiss homes and businesses with fibre-optic cabling as quickly as possible, Swisscom favours a cooperation model in which the new infrastructure is rolled out with partners such as utility providers or telecommunication companies that are willing to invest. Cooperation agreements have already been concluded in seven major cities (Basle, Berne, Geneva, Lausanne, Lucerne, St. Gallen and Zurich), one town (Pfyn) and one canton (Fribourg). To avoid a parallel rollout and ensure competition — on infrastructure — at a very early stage, the major players in the fibre market came to an agreement with the Federal Communications Commission (ComCom) in autumn 2009 to implement a multi-fibre architecture. Moreover, it was agreed that all network and service providers would have access under the same conditions and to the various network levels. This ultimately ensures that consumers are free to choose their telecom provider. The players in the fibre market also agreed on other standards such as using the single connector type for plugs in homes. Thanks to this, customers shouldn't encounter any problems when switching providers.","1529-2517;15292517","","10.1109/RFIC.2012.6242220","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6242220","","","","","","1","","","","","17-19 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a scheme to share backup servers in the Inter-cloud. To evaluate the cost reduction effect of this scheme, we design a model for calculating the optimal number of backup servers and assume several domains of applicability.

The development in this field has led to a large panel of drug delivery systems, which can be classified into 3 different nanovector generations. However, the success of such smart materials requires the control of a large variety of properties and parameters. Unfortunately, characterization at the nanoscale is often cumbersome and many methods are still being developed. Liposomes have been characterized by cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoTEM) for quite some time, also in combination with nanoparticles, in particular with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) incorporated inside the liposomal membrane. CryoTEM, unlike classical TEM, maintains the native state of the liposomes. The quick freezing of the sample immobilizes particles and liposomes exactly at their position in the suspension. Therefore, localization information can be extracted from the images. However, data must be treated extremely carefully keeping in mind that 2-D projections of a 3-D object are observed. In this paper, we discuss the analysis of cryoTEM images of liposome-particle hybrids, including the estimation of the contrast transfer function (CTF) and electron dose, as well as the correct positioning of the sample holder and tomography for accurate localization.","0018-9464;00189464","","10.1109/TMAG.2012.2219040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392365","Cryo-EM;iron oxide nanoparticles;liposomes;tomography","Drugs;Electron microscopy;Lipidomics;Magnetic resonance imaging;Nanoparticles;Suspensions","biomembranes;cryogenics;drug delivery systems;nanobiotechnology;optical transfer function;transmission electron microscopy","CryoTEM;controlled therapy;cryogenic electron microscopy;drug delivery system;liposome membrane;nanocarrier;smart material;spatial SPION localization;superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle;targeted therapy;tomography","","0","","37","","","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most of the recent video codecs, H.264, H.265 (HEVC), VC-1 uses in-loop de-blocking (LPF) filter in decoder path. Each video codec standard defines fixed order of filter operation to have consistency in universal decoder output. Standard defined fixed edge order is not optimal for various architectures of de-blocking Hardware Accelerator (HWA), as it will have to compromise on performance, power or area. Pipelining of unfiltered pixel loading with filter operation, internal storage to keep partially or fully filtered pixels and order of storage of fully filtered pixels are some of the challenges that are difficult to meet with standard defined edge order. In this paper, a novel approach of customizing edge order is discussed for differing architectural requirements and for various video codec standards.

Brady","Massachusetts Inst. of Technol., Cambridge, MA, USA","2014 IEEE Aerospace Conference","","2014","","","1","8","This paper introduces a compact optical payload enabling vision-based navigation and hazard detection during terrestrial rocket flights. This payload, the Terrain-Relative Navigation & Descent Imager (TRNDI), serves as an add-on module for Draper Laboratory's GENIE Autonomous-GNC system. GENIE's inertial navigation system relies on GPS during terrestrial test flights, making it insufficient for GPS-denied, extraterrestrial environments. The TRNDI system includes a horizon-pointing monochromatic camera, two downward-pointing monochromatic cameras, and a robust single-board computer. TRNDI utilizes a modular software framework, which allows multiple algorithms to run in real-time and communicate with the primary GENIE flight computer. This system enables data collection and real-time data processing for further development and evaluation of vision-based terrain-relative navigation, visual odometry, and hazard detection algorithms, with a path toward future closed-loop integration with GENIE's navigation system. This paper presents an overview of the TRNDI algorithms and hardware, as well as simulated results from two vision-based hazard detection (HD) algorithms. The first HD algorithm searches the camera field of view for suitable landing sites. The second HD algorithm creates a map of the relative safety of the landing region. The simulated results demonstrate that TRNDI can reliably find and deliver a safe landing site to GENIE in realtime during a planetary approach trajectory.","1095-323X;1095323X","","10.1109/AERO.2014.6836216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836216","","Cameras;Computers;Hazards;High definition video;Navigation;Rockets;Vehicles","Global Positioning System;aircraft navigation;aircraft testing;avionics;cameras;data acquisition;distance measurement;inertial navigation;inertial systems;microcomputers;monochromators;planetary surfaces;rockets","Draper Laboratory;GENIE flight computer;GENIE inertial navigation system;GPS;TRNDI algorithms;TRNDI system;add-on module;autonomous GNC system;camera field of view;closed loop integration;data collection;horizon pointing monochromatic camera;inertial navigation system;landing region;modular software framework;planetary approach trajectory;real-time data processing;single board computer;terrain relative navigation;terrain relative navigation & descent imager;terrestrial rocket flight approach;terrestrial test flights;vision-based hazard detection;vision-based navigation;visual odometry","","2","","23","","","1-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we study IEEE 802.16e mobile WiMAX network at the active mode in order to maximize the transmission rate at the uplink sub-frame space taking into account acceptable energy consumption and efficient burst profiles. We propose a mechanism to achieve this aim based on which the base station chooses an adequate modulation level.

Often, deterministic information is assumed to be readily available, i.e., uncertainties are not factored in most manufacturing settings; in reality, the opposite endures. This paper aims to address this through proposing a fuzzy mathematical programming model to solve the problem of order-promising under supply uncertainties. The model minimizes the cost associated with order rejections, promised order lapses, and inventory holding of the finished products and supply materials. In addition, the model caters to order fulfillment, provides a master production schedule for each product and material requirement planning of its respective raw material. Possibility theory is employed to solve the fuzzy mathematical model. After which, the model is evaluated against a deterministic ATP model under different scenarios. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of the fuzzy model is performed with respect to different user-specific input parameters.","2326-8123;23268123","","10.1109/ICCIS.2011.6070345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6070345","","Intelligent systems;Manufacturing;Materials;Mathematical model;Modeling;Production;Uncertainty","fuzzy set theory;manufacturing systems;mathematical programming","business decision maker;deterministic information;fuzzy mathematical model;fuzzy mathematical programming model;intelligent available-to-promise system;inventory holding;manufacturing decision;manufacturing uncertainty;master production schedule;material requirement planning;order rejection;order-promising;possibility theory;raw material;resource availability;sensitivity analysis;supply material;supply uncertainty;time phasing","","0","","9","","","17-19 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When we consider workflows and their dependencies, monitoring from the user point of view is not found in the literature of cloud middlewares. In this paper, we present an infrastructure for execution of service workflows in private clouds with tools that allow the user to keep track of his/her workflows, measuring each activity performed in the cloud resources. Through this monitoring, our workflow manager is able to react during the workflow execution, requesting new or better resources in order to the execution to comply with the application quality of service requirements. Besides that, the metrics that our monitoring system offers allow users to keep a detailed track of the organization internal costs involved in the processing, and then use this information to evaluate other alternatives, such as leasing resources from public cloud providers.","","","10.1109/LatinCloud.2012.6508153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508153","","","cloud computing;costing;middleware;organisational aspects","application service quality requirements;cloud computing environments;cloud middlewares;computational resources;networking resources;organization internal costs;private clouds;public cloud providers;service workflow monitoring;storage resources;workflow manager","","0","","19","","","26-27 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This property of mean residual life function allows introducing a new condition-based maintenance strategy whose preventive maintenance decision is based on the mean residual life.

"A Three-Dimensional Adaptive Integral Method for Scattering From Structures Embedded in Layered Media","K. Yang; A. E.

The proposed scheme accelerates the iterative method-of-moments (MOM) solution of the combined-field integral equation by employing a 3-D auxiliary regular grid. It uses the auxiliary grid to execute the standard four-stage AIM procedure; unlike the procedure for free space, two different sets of matrices are obtained for the AIM propagation stage by decomposing the Green functions to terms that are in convolution or correlation form in the stratification direction. These matrices are in (three level) block-Toeplitz and Hankel-(two level)-block-Toeplitz forms and can be multiplied by using 3-D FFTs. The dominant computational costs of the scheme are the evaluation of <i>O</i>(<i>N</i>) different layered-medium Green functions, which is accelerated by extracting asymptotic terms and using interpolation tables, and the matrix multiplications in the propagation stage, which require only <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sub>C</sub> log <i>N</i><sub>C</sub>) per iteration; these should be contrasted to the <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>) Green function evaluations and <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>) operations per iteration required by the classical MOM. Here, <i>N</i><sub>C</sub> denotes the number of nodes on the auxiliary grid, and <i>N</i> denotes the number of degrees of freedom of the surface current density. Numerical results validate the proposed method's complexity, demonstrate its accuracy for several large-scale structures in layered media, and compare its computational costs to those of its counterpart for free space.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2166765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6031916","Fast Fourier transform (FFT);integral equations;layered media","Arrays;Green function;Interpolation;Moment methods;Nonhomogeneous media;Scattering;Transmission line matrix methods","Green's function methods;Toeplitz matrices;electromagnetic wave propagation;electromagnetic wave scattering;fast Fourier transforms;inhomogeneous media;interpolation;iterative methods;matrix multiplication;method of moments","3D FFT;3D auxiliary regular grid;AIM propagation stage;Hankel-block-Toeplitz forms;MOM;combined-field integral equation;dominant computational cost;electrically large perfect electrically conducting structure;interpolation tables;iterative method-of-moments solution;large-scale structure;layered-medium Green function;matrix multiplication;planar layered medium;standard four-stage AIM procedure;stratification direction;surface current density;three-dimensional adaptive integral method","","16","","34","","20110929","April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The die temperature is estimated and monitored on each device during power converter operation. Based on the monitored temperature in real time, the maximum power capability is detected. The output power is increased until a safe operating temperature of power modules. This enable a power density is increased by 11.16 kW /litre to 19.13 kW /litre in a low voltage power stack which is typically used in wind power converters. Experiment results are shown for safe operation of converter at around 1.2 MW, which is built in a standard size for the 600-700 kW.

But, it has an inevitable problem of getting exploited for forgery therefore an automatic signature recognition and verification system is required. Verification can be accomplished either Online or Offline based application. Offline systems work on the scanned image of a signature. Online systems use dynamic information like pressure, speed etc. of a signature during the time when the signature is made. In this paper, we present an offline signature verification technique based on geometric features. We have used six geometric features namely Area, Centroid, Standard deviation, Even pixels, Kurtosis and Skewness. In our technique first the preprocessing of a scanned signature image is done to isolate the signature and to remove noise. The system is trained using a database of signatures obtained from authenticated users. Then artificial neural network (ANN) is used in recognition and verification of signatures: genuine or forged, and efficiency is about 89.24% having threshold of 80%. Simulation results shows that the technique is robust and clearly differentiates between genuine and forgery signatures.","","","10.1109/RAIT.2016.7507937","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507937","False Acceptance Rate;False Rejection Rate;Geometric feature;Neural network;Offline signature","Databases;Feature extraction;Forgery;Information technology;Neural networks;Standards","feature extraction;handwriting recognition;image denoising;neural nets","ANN;artificial neural network;automatic signature recognition system;automatic signature verification system;forgery signatures;geometric feature extraction;offline signature verification technique;online systems;personal verification;scanned signature image","","","","","","","3-5 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Errors in Service design stage often pass through multiple levels of amplification to subsequent stages of development and maintenance. Early detection of Service design faults reduces the cumulative effect on succeeding stages of service development.

Most load forecasting studies in the literature are on the wholesale side. Minimal research efforts have been devoted to tackling the challenges on the retail side, such as limited data history and high customer attrition rate. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution to long-term retail energy forecasting in order to feed the forecasts to a conservative trading strategy. We dissect the problem into two sub-problems: 1) load per customer forecasting; and 2) tenured customer forecasting. Regression analysis and survival analysis are applied to each sub-problem respectively. The proposed methodology has been implemented at a fast growing retailer in the U.S., showing superior performance in terms of mean absolute percentage error of hourly demand and daily and monthly energy over a common industry practice that assumes constant customer attrition rate.","1949-3053;19493053","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2388078","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7021896","Customer attrition;electric load forecasting;linear models;long-term load forecasting (LTLF);regression analysis;retail energy forecasting;survival analysis","Companies;Forecasting;History;Load forecasting;Load modeling;Planning;Predictive models","load forecasting;power markets","constant customer attrition rate;electric power industry deregulation;hourly demand;load forecasting;load per customer forecasting;long-term retail energy forecasting;mean absolute percentage error;residential customer attrition;retail markets;tenured customer forecasting;trading strategy;wholesale markets","","2","","24","","20150126","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Previous work suggests that this architectural drift is, in part, due to programmers' lack of architecture awareness as they develop code. JITTAC is a tool that uses a real-time Reflexion Modeling approach to inform programmers of the architectural consequences of their programming actions as, and often just before, they perform them. Thus, it provides developers with Just-In-Time architectural awareness towards promoting consistency between the as-designed architecture and the as-implemented system. JITTAC also allows programmers to give real-time feedback on introduced inconsistencies to the architect. This facilitates programmer-driven architectural change, when validated by the architect, and allows for more timely team-awareness of the actual architectural consistency of the system. Thus, it is anticipated that the tool will decrease architectural inconsistency over time and improve both developers' and architect's knowledge of their software's architecture.

Decreasing the number of test cases that are executed during testing will therefore reduce the costs involved in testing a model transformation. However, there is a trade-off: to be confident that the transformation fulfils its specification requires the execution of sufficient test cases to fully exercise the transformation. In this paper, we demonstrate a process that derives a method of sampling random models which enables the test engineer to balance testing cost and testing efficacy. The output of the process is an optimised probability distribution over the models on which the transformation acts; test sets that efficiently exercise the transformation may then be derived by sampling models from the optimised distribution. Furthermore, we describe benefits and challenges of combining model-driven engineering and search-based software engineering tools and techniques, which include conflating metamodels with grammars to enable grammar-based search techniques over a set of models, and the need to increase the scalability of model-driven engineering tools to make them more amenable to search.","","","10.1109/CMSBSE.2013.6604431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6604431","","Grammar;Manuals;Probability distribution;Software;Software algorithms;Statistical analysis;Testing","grammars;program testing;sampling methods;search problems;software cost estimation;statistical distributions","grammar-based search techniques;metamodels;model transformations;model-driven engineering;optimised probability distribution;probabilistic testing;sampling random models;scalability;search-based software engineering;testing cost;testing efficacy","","1","","15","","","20-20 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The response of the measurement system is described using a pre-defined mathematical model that depends on a set of parameters. These parameters are determined using a limited set of experimental measurement points e.g. efficiency curve, dose rates... etc. The model that agrees with the few experimental points is called an experimentally validated model. Once these models have been validated, we use mathematical interpolation to find the parameters of interest. Sometimes, when measurements are not practical or are impossible extrapolation is implemented but with care. CANBERRA has been extensively using mathematical modeling for the design and calibration of large and sophisticated systems to create and optimize designs that would be prohibitively expensive with only experimental tools. The case studies that will be presented here are primarily performed with MCNP, CANBERRA's MERCURAD/PASCALYS and ISOCS (InSitu Object Counting Software).

We then extend these findings in a second simulation study by demonstrating that reducing the width of the occluder also increases attention toward the occluded object, though unexpectedly, only for low levels of spatial competition.

The novelty of the proposal is that the representation of SB, which is generated by ANFIS, is used as the security constraint of an optimal power flow (OPF). The combination of the differentiable function and the constraint of the OPF will make the system reach its best economic benefit under the basic require of system security. The effectiveness of the proposed ANFIS method, as well as the feasibility of using the approach to analyze a layering and zoning network, is demonstrated through testing and simulation using the IEEE 118 bus test system. Results show that the proposed method can be used to the dispatch optimization in layering and zoning system, and is a better approach in speed and precision.","","","10.1109/EEEIC.2012.6221589","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6221589","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system;layering and zoning;optimal power flow;security boundary","Load flow;Load modeling;Mathematical model;Notice of Violation;Numerical stability;Power system stability;Security;Stability analysis","IEEE standards;approximation theory;fuzzy reasoning;load dispatching;load flow;power engineering computing;power system economics;power system security","ANFIS application;IEEE 118 bus test system;OPF;SB constraint approximation;adaptive neurofuzzy inference system application;differentiable function;dispatch optimization;layering network analysis;optimal power flow;security boundary constraint approximation;zoning network analysis","","0","","17","","","18-25 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Investigation of aging degradation status of insulating elements in oil-immersed transformer and its diagnostic method based on field measurement data","S. Okabe; G. Ueta; T. Tsuboi","Tokyo Electric Power Company 4-1, Egasaki-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, 230-8510, Japan","IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","","2013","20","1","346","355","To ensure the reliability of oil-immersed power transformers in long-term operation, the influence of aging on various characteristics of their insulating elements must be clarified. The present paper reviewed the degradation status of insulating oil and paper of field-aged transformers, covering investigative results ranging from about 30 years ago to a relatively recent period. The field transformers treated were diverse in terms of their manufacturing year, manufacturer, structure, and voltage class. Despite the examination results of such wide-ranging transformers, there were similar changes in various characteristics due to the aging of insulating oil and paper. For example, as for the insulating oil, due to the aging for about 30 years, the characteristics of the total acid value and volume resistivity had degraded, whereas the breakdown voltage decreased only slightly. Regarding the insulating paper, mechanical characteristics such as the average polymerization degree (DP) were subject to age-related decline, whereas the breakdown voltage did not significantly decrease as with insulating oil. Therefore, based on use of about 30 years, since the life of a transformer is determined by factors such as the degradation of mechanical strength due to thermal stress, insulation degradation is considered less likely to pose a problem at an early stage. Even though it is difficult to directly measure the degree of degradation of insulating paper, this can be indirectly estimated by measuring the CO<sub>2</sub> and CO content and furfural content in insulating oil. On the other hand, given the increasing number of transformers remaining in service over 30 years, which had been deemed the expected service life, consideration must be taken to aging degradation of the insulation performance. It emerged that, in order to identify the degree of degradation of these transformers, it was effective to manage the volume resistivity and dielectric loss tangent trends in electric- l terms, the interfacial tension trend in physical terms and the total acid value trend in chemical terms. Analysis of the insulating oil components is also considered an effective means of evaluating aging degradation.","1070-9878;10709878","","10.1109/TDEI.2013.6451376","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6451376","Oil-immersed power transformer;aging;average polymerization degree (DP);breakdownvoltage;insulating oil;insulating paper;oil components","Aging;Degradation;Dielectric breakdown;Materials;Oil insulation;Power transformer insulation","ageing;carbon compounds;paper;polymerisation;power transformer insulation;reliability;surface tension;thermal stresses;transformer oil","CO;CO<sub>2</sub>;aging degradation evaluation;average polymerization degree;breakdown voltage;dielectric loss tangent;field measurement data;field-aged transformer paper;insulating elements;insulating oil;insulating paper;interfacial tension trend;manufacturer, structure;manufacturing year;mechanical characteristics;mechanical strength degradation;oil-immersed power transformer reliability;power transformer diagnostic method;thermal stress;total acid value;voltage class;volume resistivity had","","14","","20","","","February 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Measurement standards for industrial converters and complete electric drives, including both motors and converters, will come into effect soon, and measurement methods for these devices should be included. In the calorimetric method, the power losses are measured directly. However, the calorimeters presented previously are mainly tailored systems, and therefore, they typically have very complicated constructions. Hence, their applicability to the evaluation of general electric drives is limited. A functional calorimetric measurement concept is suggested in this study for power losses up to 2 kW. Such a power loss can be applied with present-day power electronic converters up to 110 kW. The construction of the concept is simple and lightweight. It does not require a complex structure or a large area in the measurement site. The concept is scalable and duplicable for different sizes. Different devices with different cablings can be measured without any problems. The combined standard heat loss measurement uncertainty for the calorimeter is ±0.4%.","1751-8660;17518660","","10.1049/iet-epa.2012.0109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6563224","","","calorimetry;heat losses;loss measurement;motor drives;power convertors","calorimetric measurement concept;electric drive;heat loss measurement uncertainty;industrial converter;motor;power electronic converter;power loss measurement","","9","","","","","July 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The FA-PID control algorithm was successfully implemented in Matlab software using its M programming language, and integrated tightly with configuration and monitoring software KINGVIEW through their dynamic data exchange (DDE) channel.

"A novel cross-layer modeling framework for analyzing SOA-based information services","R. Vaidyanathan; Gi Tae Kim; A. Kolarov; F. Caruso; G. Forbes","Telcordia Technologies Inc., USA","2011 - MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference","","2011","","","2019","2024","Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based information systems and services are finding ever wider applicability in complex, mission-critical operational environments. In order to effectively help design and prepare information sharing services for such complex operational environments, designers have to consider various architecture tradeoffs and interactions across the SOA application, communication middleware and network infrastructure layers. Currently, there is a paucity of tools that address this critical need. In this paper, we describe a novel modeling and analysis framework for analyzing and evaluating the performance of SOA-based information services and their myriad design & deployment options over varying network infrastructures under varying conditions of network load. Our modeling framework defines critical Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) to characterize performance of candidate applications considering the SOA interaction characteristics, as well as the underlying SOA communication middleware and network infrastructures. These MOEs can quantify & evaluate specific Service Oriented Architectures and design/deployment strategies against required Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. Our modeling framework provides the ability to both analyze as-is application scenarios as well as potential alternative architectures that may include differing application characteristics (e.g. increase in the application's data generation rate), varying the SOA interaction characteristics (e.g. pub-sub vs. request-response communication styles, use of JSON vs. XML for data-interchange, use of SAML security tokens etc.) or network characteristics (e.g. varying background traffic and latency). A key feature of our modeling framework is the ability to uncover issues resulting from adverse or unforeseen interactions between the Application, SOA interactions and Network layers. Our initial results on evaluating Information sharing services across enterprise inter-agenc- infrastructures interconnected by public/private networks demonstrate the viability of our cross-layer modeling framework.","2155-7578;21557578","","10.1109/MILCOM.2011.6127615","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6127615","OPNET;SOA;application;cross-layer;middleware;modeling;network infrastructure;publish-subscribe;request-response","Analytical models;Authentication;Delay;Quality of service;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Service oriented architecture","aerospace computing;information services;information systems;middleware;quality of service;service-oriented architecture;software performance evaluation","JSON;SAML security tokens;SOA application;SOA communication middleware;SOA-based information services;XML;application data generation rate;background latency;background traffic;complex mission-critical operational environments;cross-layer modeling framework;data-interchange;deployment strategies;design strategies;enterprise interagency infrastructures;information sharing services;measures-of-effectiveness;network infrastructure layers;network infrastructures;performance evaluation;private networks;public networks;quality-of-service metrics;request-response communication styles;service oriented architecture based information systems","","1","","4","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, the mapping rules between both meta-models are defined as the common transformation specification regardless of what modeling language or methodology is employed in developing architectural descriptions. Finally, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) technologies are discussed to facilitate the automated transformation of executable models from architectural instance data.

In this paper, we propose a novel active skeleton representation towards low latency human action recognition . First, we encode each limb of the human skeleton into a state through a Markov random field. The active skeleton is then represented by aggregating the encoded features of individual limbs. Finally, we propose a multi-channel multiple instance learning with maximum-pattern-margin to further boost the performance of the existing model. Our method is robust in calculating features related to joint positions, and effective in handling the unsegmented sequences.

Ecuador 3659, CHILE","Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC), 2012 IEEE","","2012","","","2452","2455","Large-scale statistical reconstruction algorithms are known to be memory and processor intensive applications. For instance, the system matrix for a small animal scanner requires several gigabytes of memory storage and the algorithm usually needs many iterations to produce acceptable images. In this abstract we design distributed-shared memory (DSM) statistical reconstruction algorithms to exploit all available computational resources as a unified infrastructure and thereby improving the cost-efficiency of the investment and scalability of the system. We use and compare two distinct approaches. The first one uses the Unified Parallel C (UPC) compiler which transparently provides a global shared virtual address space across all computers. Data is physically stored in different computers, but threads can access any shared item as it if were in its local memory. The second approach combines OpenMP and Pthreads shared-memory libraries with the message-passing library MPI. In this case threads only have access to the node's local memory and access to remote data is carried out explicitly through message-passing. Early UPC experiments showed that keeping all data shared heavily affects reconstruction performance. Therefore, we devised a distribution method where some data is kept shared and other is kept private, mimicking somehow the library-based approach. However, even with data privatization, the compiler solution cannot compete with the library solutions. We explore three workload distribution strategies: LOR-based, Nonzero-based and Cores-based. The best performance is obtained with OpenMP+MPI and the Core-based balance algorithm, which reaches a speedup of 36 with 112 cores. However, both OpenMP+MPI and Pthreads+MPI outperform UPC by large. The low system efficiency of 0.32 is mainly due to the slow internode communication network.","1082-3654;10823654","","10.1109/NSSMIC.2012.6551558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6551558","Distributed-shared memory;Statistical Reconstruction","","application program interfaces;computerised tomography;distributed shared memory systems;image reconstruction;iterative methods;message passing;program compilers;statistical analysis","DSM statistical reconstruction algorithms;LOR-based workload distribution strategy;MPI;OpenMP libraries;Pthreads shared-memory libraries;UPC compiler;animal scanner;computational resources;core-based workload distribution strategy;data privatization;distributed-shared memory computed tomography;distributed-shared memory statistical reconstruction algorithms;distribution method;global shared virtual address space;internode communication network;investment cost-efficiency;iterations;large-scale statistical reconstruction algorithms;local memory;memory intensive applications;memory storage gigabytes;message-passing library;node local memory;nonzero-based workload distribution strategy;processor intensive applications;remote data;system matrix;unified infrastructure;unified parallel C compiler","","0","","6","","","Oct. 27 2012-Nov. 3 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When applied to the resonator through additional signal ports, the tuning signal electrically modifies the equivalent mechanical stiffness or mass of the resonator, thereby tuning the resonance frequency in a bidirectional fashion depending on the polarity of the scaling. This tuning scheme has been applied to a piezoelectric AlN-on-Si BAW square resonator to tune its 14.2 MHz resonance frequency by 22 kHz, equivalent to 1550 ppm.

The guidance information extraction method was studied, as well as the method to design a required autopilot. Based on six-freedom trajectory model, the mathematic simulation was done. The result shows that the strategy is validate and is robustness enough. It can satisfy the requirement to strike the moving target.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6640334","guidance information extraction;guidance strategy;moving target;strap-down seeker","Aircraft navigation;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Imaging;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;Missiles","infrared imaging;missile guidance;proportional control;trajectory control","air-to-ground missile;attacking area;autopilot design;carrier aircraft;measurement data;moving target;proportional navigation guidance law;quasibody pursuit guidance;six-freedom trajectory model;strapdown imaging infrared seeker","","0","","3","","","26-28 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nowadays, the development of the next generation MDTV service has progressed in terms of both hardware layers and software, with interactive services becoming one of the future trends. However, current MDTV interactive service generation process relies too much on commercial solutions, resulting in most parts of the process being proprietary. In addition, this has increased the technical demands for developers and the cost of producing and maintaining MDTV services. In light of the aforementioned situation, this paper proposes an innovative MDTV service generation solution, which introduces a semi-automatic creation mechanism to facilitate a less technical and more efficient interactive service creation process. By employing open-standard technologies including XHTML and Java ME for the service presentation the proposed work benefits are twofold. Firstly it helps in reducing the technical demands of MDTV service production for service creators. Secondly it improves the inter-compatibility of the created service application amongst different MDTV standards. Initial test results indicate that the proposed solution allows for a faster and more effective MDTV interactive service generation.","0018-9316;00189316","","10.1109/TBC.2013.2256676","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6515311","Application software;digital television;middleware;mobile television;usability;user interface","","mobile television;telecommunication computing;user interfaces;video on demand","DTV industry;Java ME;XHTML;digital television;interactive service generation process;mobile devices;next generation MDTV service;open-standard technology;semiautomated mobile digital TV service generation;semiautomatic creation mechanism","","0","","40","","20130513","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the advent of commodity computing servers has brought the two arenas closer than they have ever been. Within enterprise computing, commodity computing servers have resulted in the development of a wide range of new cloud capabilities: elastic computing, virtualization, and data hosting. Similarly, the supercomputing community has developed new capabilities in heterogeneous, massively parallel hardware and software. Merging the benefits of enterprise clouds and supercomputing has been a challenging goal. Significant effort has been expended in trying to deploy supercomputing capabilities on cloud computing systems. These efforts have resulted in unreliable, low-performance solutions, which requires enormous expertise to maintain. LLSuperCloud provides a novel solution to the problem of merging enterprise cloud and supercomputing technology. More specifically LLSuperCloud reverses the traditional paradigm of attempting to deploy supercomputing capabilities on a cloud and instead deploys cloud capabilities on a supercomputer. The result is a system that can handle heterogeneous, massively parallel workloads while also providing high performance elastic computing, virtualization, and databases. The benefits of LLSuperCloud are highlighted using a mixed workload of C MPI, parallel MATLAB, Java, databases, and virtualized Web services.","","","10.1109/HPEC.2013.6670329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6670329","cloud computing;high performance computing;virtual machines","Cloud computing;Databases;Hardware;MATLAB;Servers;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","C language;Java;Web services;application program interfaces;cloud computing;parallel processing;software prototyping;virtual machines;virtualisation","C MPI;HPC system sharing;Java;LLSuperCloud;cloud capabilities;commodity computing servers;data hosting;elastic computing;enterprise computing;heterogeneous massively parallel hardware;heterogeneous massively parallel software;high-performance computing;parallel MATLAB;rapid prototyping;supercomputing;virtualization;virtualized Web services","","6","","24","","","10-12 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this system, data collection, processing, and simulations are performed in a distributed fashion. Each individual simulator models the current traffic conditions of its local vicinity focusing only on its area of interest, without modeling other less relevant areas. Collectively, a central server coordinates the overall simulations with an optimistic execution technique and provides a predictive model of traffic conditions in large areas by combining simulations geographically spread over large areas. This distributed approach increases computing capacity of the entire system and speed of execution. The proposed model manages the distributed network, synchronizes the predictions among simulators, and resolves simulation output conflicts. Proper feedback allows each simulator to have accurate input data and eventually produce predictions close to reality. Such a system could provide both more up-to-date and robust predictions than that offered by centralized simulations within a single transportation management center. As these systems evolve, the mobile computing online traffic predictions can be used in surface transportation management and travelers will benefit from more accurate and reliable traffic forecast.","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2013.6717855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717855","","Computational modeling;Data models;Mobile computing;Real-time systems;Traffic control;Vehicles","data handling;digital simulation;mobile computing;traffic information systems","ad hoc distributed simulation;central server;centralized simulations;computing capacity;data collection;data processing;data simulations;distributed approach;mobile computing online traffic predictions;mobile computing traffic simulation data process;optimistic execution;optimistic execution technique;reliable traffic forecast;surface transportation management;transportation management center","","0","","16","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed designs have the objectives of providing either guaranteed or best-effort quality of service (QoS). A randomly interleaved rateless encoder is proposed whereby users only need to decode symbols up to their own QoS level. The proposed coder is optimized based on measured transmission properties of standardized raptor codes over wireless channels. It is shown that a guaranteed QoS problem formulation can be transformed into a convex optimization problem, yielding a globally optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed optimized random interleaved UEP rateless coder's performance compares favorably with that of other recently proposed UEP rateless codes.","1229-2370;12292370","","10.1109/JCN.2015.000043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155728","Error control coding;multimedia;raptor codes;unequal error protection;video transmission","Bandwidth;Decoding;Encoding;Multimedia communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Streaming media","codes;convex programming;multicast communication;multimedia communication;quality of service;wireless channels","QoS;UEP;convex optimization;fixed-rate codes;multimedia multicasting;quality of service;raptor codes;unequal error protection rateless codes;wireless channels","","1","","","","","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Univ., Hong Kong, China","IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","","2014","61","2","637","648","The recent development in computer science that the power demand and required time of code execution can be accurately predicted is paving a path that may lead to a new paradigm shift in power supply design. Specifically, while the design of power supplies now normally assumes that load current changes at random times and with unknown magnitudes (within a range), future computer loads may communicate with power supplies to provide information that facilitates power management. Such information would include the exact times of occurrence of load transients and their magnitudes. Following this trend of development where the power supply is “informed” by the load, we propose to use an auxiliary circuit that generates a slowly rising current prior to the occurrence of the actual transient. The slowly rising current can cause the power supply to shift its operation point to a new level slowly without exhibiting output voltage fluctuation. The actual load exhibits very fast current transient, but the combination of actual load and auxiliary circuit behaves as a slowly changing load which can be dealt with by an ordinary power supply capable of handling slowly changing load current. Thus, this method essentially buffers the power supply from large and fast transients. Our proposed approach involves the necessary algorithm for controlling the auxiliary circuit in accordance with the information provided by the microprocessor. The design of the auxiliary circuit is explained and experimental results for a 1.5 V load with 15 A step current are provided for verification.","1549-8328;15498328","","10.1109/TCSI.2013.2278391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584805","Auxiliary circuit;dc-dc converter;fast transient;large transient;load-informed power management;microprocessor power supply","Capacitors;Hardware;Microprocessors;Power supplies;Switches;Switching circuits;Transient analysis","computer science;load management;microprocessor chips;power supply circuits;transient analysis","actual load;code execution;computer loads;computer science;current 15 A;load current;load-informed power management;microprocessor;power supply;pre-energized auxiliary circuits;random times;transient loads;unknown magnitudes;voltage 1.5 V","","7","","29","","20130822","Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These courses often fail to relate the different steps and stages of RE to each other and do not address crucial communication and project management issues that are common in industrial RE practice. They also miss the chance for using the classroom as a near-to-real-settings research lab, and won't show students the stakes existing in doing engineering in our society. We describe our experiences in teaching RE with a case study in two universities, achieving a triple-win: putting students in contact with real stakeholders, showing students their responsibility towards a sustainable world and doing empirical research in the classroom. We report on the course design, the evaluation, the lessons learned, and the potential success factors for such courses.

This work tries to define gamification by using lexical meaning approach as the starting point and viewing it from a process viewpoint. Lexical meaning approach interprets gamification as a process or a product of the process. From this perspective, gamification can be viewed as a process that adds certain characteristics to an object that makes the object different from its previous condition and feasible to be formalized. Furthermore, the resulting definition is tested by comparing it to other existing gamification definitions and the understanding that constructs the definition is used as the foundation to explain the differences between gamification and serious games. This paper then defines gamification as a process that integrates game elements into gameless objects in order to have gameful characteristics. There will be a situation where gamification will produce a state of gameful reality: a situation in the real world where people can feel the significant presence of gamefulness in their daily life.","","","10.1109/ICITSI.2014.7048279","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7048279","definition;gameful reality;gamification;lexical meaning;process viewpoint","Companies;Context;Games;Marine animals;Market research;Object recognition","serious games (computing)","game elements;game-related strategies;gameful reality;gameless objects;gamification;lexical meaning approach;process viewpoint;serious games","","0","","26","","","24-27 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an efficient bandwidth management scheme, named WiMAX Dynamic Channel Allocation Scheme (WDCAS), is proposed. The scheme uses the cognitive radio for dynamic channel allocation in order to improve the bandwidth utilization while satisfying the QoS requirements. A queuing model based on the maximum entropy principle for performance analysis is introduced, and closed-form expressions for the state probability and the blocking probability are obtained.

The goal is to assign tasks to cores so that interdependent tasks are performed by ""nearby"" cores, thus lowering the distance messages must travel, the amount of congestion in the network, and the overall cost of communication. Our new method applies a geometric partitioning algorithm to both the tasks and the processors, and assigns task parts to the corresponding processor parts.

In addition to the DC CM voltage imposed by the MVDC grid, the use of switching power electronics results in high frequency (HF) CM voltage applied to the HF isolation transformers used in the proposed approaches. While DC CM voltages stress transformer insulation, HF CM voltages also cause current to flow through parasitic capacitances between transformer primary and secondary windings, as well as between transformer windings and the grounded chassis where it then circulates back to the WTG grounded neutral. Detailed simulation results indicate that use of a per-pole interface architecture leads to lower and more balanced CM voltage stress on isolation transformers, which would reduce cost and increase reliability of the interface. A CM filter and transformer shield are applied as mitigation strategies; corresponding simulation results show a reduction in the common mode current in the WTG neutral in both per-phase and per-pole interfaces.","2329-3721;23293721","","10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7309727","Circulating Ground Current;Common Mode Voltage;High Frequency Transformer (HFT);MVDC;Offshore Wind Farm;Wind Turbine Generator (WTG)","Capacitance;Capacitors;Equivalent circuits;Power transformer insulation;Stress;Wind farms;Windings","high-frequency transformers;power filters;power grids;transformer insulation;transformer windings;wind turbines","CM filter;DC CM voltages stress;HF isolation transformers;MVDC collection grid interfaces;circulating ground currents;common mode voltage stress;high frequency CM voltage;medium voltage DC collection grids;next-generation offshore wind turbines;parasitic capacitances;per-pole interface architecture;power electronic interfaces;switching power electronics;transformer insulation;transformer primary windings;transformer secondary windings;transformer shield","","","","18","","","20-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This focus is due to the early success of the superstrate structure in producing high-efficiency cells, problems of suitable ohmic contacts for lightly doped CdTe, and the simplicity of the structure for manufacturing. The development of the CdCl<sub>2</sub> heat treatment boosted CdTe technology and perpetuated the use of the superstrate structure. However, despite the beneficial attributes of the superstrate structure, devices with a substrate structure are attractive both commercially and scientifically. The substrate structure eliminates the need for transparent superstrates and thus allows the use of flexible metal and possibly plastic substrates. From a scientific perspective, it allows better control in forming the junction and direct access to the junction for detailed analysis. Research on such devices has been limited. The efficiency of these devices has been limited to around 8% due to low open-circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) and fill factor. In this paper, we present our recent device development efforts at NREL on substrate-structure CdTe devices. We have found that processing parameters required to fabricate high-efficiency substrate CdTe PV devices differ from those necessary for traditional superstrate CdTe devices. We have worked on a variety of contact materials including Cu-doped ZnTe and Cu<sub>x</sub>Te. We will present a comparative analysis of the performance of these contacts.

Ironically, we demonstrate that when packaged in SSD format, there arise many barriers to reaching full parallelism in reads, resulting in random writes outperforming them. Motivated by this, we propose Physically Addressed Queuing (PAQ), a request scheduler that avoids resource contention resultant from shared SSD resources. PAQ makes the following major contributions: First, it exposes the physical addresses of requests to the scheduler. Second, I/O clumping is utilized to select groups of operations that can be simultaneously executed without major resource conflict. Third, inter-request NAND transaction packing empowers multi-plane-mode operations. We implement PAQ in a cycle-accurate simulator and demonstrate bandwidth and IOPS improvements greater than 62% and latency decreases as much as 41.6% for random reads, without degrading performance of other access types.","1063-6897;10636897","","10.1109/ISCA.2012.6237035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6237035","","Abstracts;Decision support systems","NAND circuits;disc storage;flash memories;queueing theory","I/O clumping;NAND flash storage;NAND transaction packing;PAQ;SSD format;multiplane mode operations;physically addressed queueing;physically addressed queuing;random access speeds;resource contention resultant;solid state disks","","1","1","29","","","9-13 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An informal verification step checks that the rules give enough permission to enable all functional requirements. The approach takes benefit of the KAOS notations to link functional and non-functional goals, agents, data, and access control rules in a single requirements model. This enables traceability between security goals and the resulting access control rules.

We have formulated the downlink resource allocation problem joining both carrier component (CC) allocation and resource block (RB) allocation to achieve proportional fairness in the long term. We also develop a maximum system utility (MSU) algorithm. Each time this algorithm tries to allocate the best CC to an narrow-band UE in which the number of CCs it is assigned does not exceed the number of CCs supported, maximizing the total utility until it can no longer grow. Importantly, NB UEs which can support more than one CCs are considered in this paper.

The basis of the proposed techniques is a new algorithm for constructing a full box from just three of its corners. The evaluation of the new techniques compares their precision and completion times in a 9 degree-of-freedom (DoF) docking experiment against an existing technique, which requires the user to perform the rotation and scaling of the box explicitly. The precision of the users' box construction is evaluated by a novel error metric measuring the difference between two boxes. The results of the experiment strongly indicate that for precision docking of 9 DoF boxes, some of the proposed techniques are significantly better than ones with explicit rotation and scaling. Another interesting result is that the number of DoF simultaneously controlled by the user significantly influences the precision of the docking.","1087-8270;10878270","","10.1109/VR.2011.5759445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5759445","3-D UI;3-D boxes;HMD;docking;interaction techniques","Equations;Face;Measurement;Mice;Resource management;Shape;Virtual environment","solid modelling","3D box shaping technique;9 degree-of-freedom docking experiment;box rotation;box scaling;rectangular box creation;virtual environments","","3","","22","","","19-23 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Chrysomya megacephala is the most forensically significant blowfly in Malaysia. In some death cases due to intoxication, it has been reported that the presence of toxins interrupted the development of immature blowflies, known as larvae that utilizes the corpse's flesh and internal organ and thus disrupt the PMI estimation. Therefore, this study was performed to examine the effects of mitragynine on C.megacephala growth spurt. Mitragynine is an active alkaloid in Mitragyna speciosa Korth or also known as Ketum. This chemical constituent of Ketum accumulated in human liver when consumed. In this study, 110 of C. megacephala larvae were reared on series of cow's liver homogenized with 0, 20g, 40g and 60g of ketum extract. Development rate of C.megacephala was observed by recording larvae length, duration of each development stages and survival rate. Duration of development was recorded in every stages of larvae instar, pupae until the blowfly emerged into adult. Survival rate on the other hand, was recorded based on the number of larvae, pupae and adult that survived to the next cycle of development. All data were compared with control group (0g). Mitragynine from larvae that consumed the mixture were extracted using SPE and detected using HPLC. Calibration curve of mitragynine standard was plotted to obtain the amount of mitragynine concentration in larvae sample. Survival rate and development of larvae exposed to 20g extract were almost similar to control with growth rate delayed by 6 hours and 69 % in survival rate. C.megacephala exposed in 40g extract delayed its growth rate by 12 hours compared to control and only 41% of larvae managed to emerge into adult. The lifecycle of C. megacephala in 60g ketum extract delayed up to 24 hours than the control and has the lowest survival rate among all test groups.

In addition, BMIs of the future will benefit from integrating kinesthesia into the control loop. Here, we examine whether changes in passively induced forefinger movement amplitude are represented in different regions than forefinger velocity via a MR compatible robotic manipulandum. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), five healthy participants were exposed to combinations of forefinger movement amplitude and velocity in a factorial design followed by an epoch-based analysis. We found that primary and secondary somatosensory regions were activated, as well as cingulate motor area, putamen and cerebellum, with greater activity from changes in velocity compared to changes in amplitude. This represents the first investigation into whole brain response to parametric changes in passive movement kinematics. In addition to informing BMIs, these results have implications towards neural correlates of robotic rehabilitation.","1945-7898;19457898","","10.1109/ICORR.2013.6650474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650474","","Educational institutions;Joints;Kinematics;Manipulators;Physiology;Positron emission tomography","biomedical MRI;brain-computer interfaces;manipulators;medical image processing;medical robotics;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation","BMI;MR compatible robotic manipulator;brain-machine interfaces;cerebellum;cingulate motor area;epoch-based analysis;fMRI;factorial design;functional magnetic resonance imaging;kinesthesia;motor cortex;movement amplitude;movement velocity;neural correlates;passive movement kinematics;passively induced forefinger movement amplitude;primary somatosensory region;putamen;robotic rehabilitation;secondary somatosensory region","","4","","29","","","24-26 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, their performance on recognition system is still not widely accepted in the machine learning community because these networks are unable to handle selectivity-invariance dilemma and also suffer from the problem of vanishing gradients. Some of these issues have been addressed by deep learning. Deep learning approaches attempt to disentangle intricate aspects of input by creating multiple levels of representation. These approaches have shown astonishing results in problem domains like recognition system, natural language processing, medical sciences, and in many other fields. The paper presents an overview of different deep learning approaches in a nutshell and also highlights some limitations which are restricting performance of deep neural networks in order to handle more realistic problems.","","","10.1109/WCI.2015.7495514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7495514","conventional neural networks;deep learning;deep neural networks","Biological neural networks;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","","","","","","80","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, such wireless networks are in an early phase of their development and need to incorporate necessary equipment and algorithms for autonomous operation. This paper presents a concept and a concrete simulation scenario showing how a distributed context management system and the data collected and distributed by such a system can improve the performance of an autonomous, coordinated wireless mesh network (ACWMN). Research agrees that it is context awareness that will transform today's networks to incorporate autonomous, coordinated behavior.

In addition, a temperature dependent study identifies a blocking temperature of 160 K by field cool and zero field cool measurements. The particle size of ~ 23 nm in diameter is estimated for a pancake shape cluster and the small particles are probably formed at the CoFeB/MgO interface at the beginning of the growth.

The task of persistent surveillance is of particular significance in that the target area needs to be continuously surveyed, minimizing the time between visitations to the same region. This distinction from one-time coverage does not allow a straightforward application of most exploration techniques to the problem, though ideas from these methods can still be used. The aerial vehicle dynamic and endurance constraints add additional complexity to the autonomous control problem, whereas stochastic environments and vehicle failures introduce uncertainty. In this work, we investigate techniques for high-level control, that are scalable, reliable, efficient, and robust to problem dynamics. Next, we suggest a modification to the control policy to account for aircraft dynamic constraints. We also devise a health monitoring policy and a control policy modification to improve performance under endurance constraints.

Our results suggest that visually impaired software developers face challenges, for instance, when using screen readers to look up information when writing code. We discuss a variety of implications, including that blind software developers need additional support in discovering relevant software development tools.","1943-6092;19436092","","10.1109/VLHCC.2012.6344485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344485","","Color;Computer languages;Interviews;Navigation;Shape;Software;Visualization","human factors;software tools","blind software developer;screen reader;software development tool;visually impaired software developer","","1","","10","","","Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 4 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transmitter works in the Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) frequency band (401 - 406 MHz) and transmits the signal at a power of -20 dBm while achieves energy efficiency of 40pJ/b. The transmitter achieves this performance through a modified pulse position modulation called saturated analog signal (SAS) which has been tailored to reduce not only the peak and average power consumption but also helps reduces the number of elements required for signal generation and dispenses the need for a crystal which in turn minimizes the overall footprint of the transmitter. The transmitter can also dynamically trade off duty cycling and energy consumption with data rate and range requirements for better operability on a constantly changing environment due to the inherent flexibility of the modulation scheme.","1094-687X;1094687X","","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6610233","","Frequency modulation;Microwave integrated circuits;Power demand;Radio transmitters;Synthetic aperture sonar","biomedical communication;biomedical electronics;data communication;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;prosthetics;transmitters","Medical Implant Communication Service;crystal;energy consumption;energy efficiency;frequency 401 MHz to 406 MHz;frequency band;implanted medical device;integrated wireless transmitter;modified pulse position modulation;neural prostheses;power 200 muW;power consumption;saturated analog signal;signal generation;signal transmission;size 130 nm;voltage 1.2 V","","1","","17","","","3-7 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, we can estimate emission in real time by using traffic simulator and emission estimation system. In this paper, we present a heterogeneous communication platform between KTH-TPMA traffic simulator and emission estimation system to measure real time traffic emission. This platform is implemented using CORBA and web service. In CORBA, synchronous and asynchronous communication methods are implemented in three different ways, which are individual, collection, and thread communication modes.

Using the recorded transient waveforms, a synchronous machine model development task is carried out as per the IEEE Std. 115-2009 specified procedures. Employing such a model a time-domain simulation programme is run to tune the model parameters of the machine by comparing the simulation results against the recorded waveforms. It is also found that the transient waveform recorder provides a useful tool to visualize the synchronization and loss-of-synchronism transients either with the mains supply or with another machine. As an additional application, an open-loop excitation controller for a synchronous machine is developed which involved the realization of many hardware circuits such as inverse-cosine firing-circuit module, single-phase thyristor bridge-rectifier circuits and a DAC interfacing card.

Our survey focuses on the control side and aims to highlight that the design philosophy for traffic control systems is undergoing a transition from feedback character to feedforward character. Moreover, we discuss some contrasting preferences in the design of traffic control systems and their relations to vehicular communications. The first pair of contrasting preferences are model-based predictive control versus simulation-based predictive control. The second pair are global planning-based control versus local self-organization-based control. The third pair are control using rich information that may be highly redundant versus control using concise information that is necessary. Both the potentials and drawbacks of these control strategies are explained.

The purpose of lubrication oil condition monitoring and degradation detection is to determine whether the oil has deteriorated to such a degree that it no longer fulfills its function. In this paper, particle contamination of lubrication oil and the remaining useful life (RUL) of the particle contaminated lubrication oil are investigated. Physical models are developed to quantify the relationship between particle contamination level and the outputs of commercially available online oil dielectric and viscosity sensors.

A plausible interpretation has been further proposed to explain the impact of low temperature microwave annealing on formation of dopant segregated Schottky junctions. The effectiveness of Schottky barrier height tuning below 400 °C by microwave annealing paves the way to form advanced source/drain and contact structures for future ultra-scaled MOSFETs and monolithic 3D sequential integration.","","","10.1109/IWJT.2015.7467094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7467094","","Annealing;Nickel alloys;Schottky diodes;Silicides;Silicon;Substrates;Tuning","MOSFET;Schottky barriers;annealing;arsenic;boron;microwave heating;nickel compounds;semiconductor doping;three-dimensional integrated circuits","NiSi:B,As;Schottky barrier height tuning;diffusion source dopant segregation;equivalent electron Schottky barrier height;equivalent hole Schottky barrier height;microwave annealing;monolithic 3D sequential integration;ultrascaled MOSFET","","","","14","","","11-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unobtrusive and flexible integration of tracking devices with clothes is difficult to achieve with standard PCB-based devices. An attractive option would be direct printing of circuit layout on the textile itself, negating the use of hard PCB materials. However, due to high surface roughness and porosity of textiles, efficient and reliable printing of electronics on textile has remained elusive. In this paper, an interface layer is first printed on the textile to facilitate the printing of a complete localization circuit and antenna for the first time. The tracking device utilizes WiFi to determine the wearer's position and can display this information on any internet-enabled device, such as smart phone. The device is small enough (55 mm × 45 mm) and lightweight (22g with 500 mAh battery) for people to comfortably wear it and can be easily concealed in case discretion is required.

In addition, the DSM promotes the integration of the new renewable sources power generation systems in the traditional electrical grid, improving the balance between local supply and energy demand. This paper proposes a novel DSM technique based on a non-cooperative game framework, to reduce the Peak to Average Ratio (PAR) of the power system, minimizing daily electricity payment of each consumer in the geographical area. Each consumer is considered like a player in an energy game and he/she is encouraged to re-schedule the energy consumption, applying an MPSO algorithm to shift in time those loads occurring during peak consumption periods. The dynamic pricing policy applied by the energy providers, leads each player to adopt the best strategy among its Pareto scheduling solutions, to minimize the energy peak in the overall load demand of a geographical area. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of this distributed game theoretical approach to the DSM problem. An appreciable PAR reduction is achieved at the price of a low information exchange between the energy provider and each consumer, keeping the user privacy safe and minimizing the overhead of signaling information over the network.","","","10.1109/EEEIC-2.2013.6737920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737920","Demand Side Management;MPSO algorithm;dynamic energy pricing;load scheduling;non cooperative game;smart grid","Energy consumption;Games;Nash equilibrium;Peak to average power ratio;Power grids;Power system dynamics;Vectors","demand side management;energy consumption;energy management systems;game theory;particle swarm optimisation;power grids;renewable energy sources","DSM technique;MPSO algorithm;MV grid;PAR;Pareto scheduling solutions;demand-side management;distributed game theoretical approach;dynamic pricing policy;electrical grid;energy consumption;energy demand;energy game;energy management;energy providers;energy resources;geographical area;local supply;noncooperative game theoretic approach;peak consumption periods;peak to average ratio;power grid;power system;renewable sources power generation systems;sustainable allocation;user privacy","","1","","17","","","1-3 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method is based on the analysis of sequential image patterns of faces and irises observed at regular time intervals. The basic concept is to represent the set of image patterns produced by the action of gazing at a certain area as a nonlinear subspace in a high-dimensional pattern vector space. Such a space is called an attention subspace. In this framework, an input subspace from an unknown action is classified into an attention subspace of gazing at a certain area or into attention subspaces of gazing at other areas (named non-attention subspaces) by measuring the canonical angles between the input subspace and pre-computed dictionary subspaces. To maintain performance even in the presence of head movement, two mechanisms are introduced: 1) the kernel orthogonal mutual subspace method, which is suitable for classifying sets of multiple images, and 2) a kernel function for considering the head position in addition to a kernel function for pixel values. The stable performance of the proposed method including situations with head movements is demonstrated through experiments.","1051-4651;10514651","","10.1109/ICPR.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976803","","Dictionaries;Head;Iris recognition;Kernel;Sensors;Vectors;Visualization","face recognition;image classification;image motion analysis;iris recognition","canonical angles;face sequential image pattern analysis;gazing action;gazing attention subspace classification;head movement;head position;high-dimensional pattern vector space;human visual attention sensing;iris sequential image pattern analysis;kernel function;kernel orthogonal mutual subspace method;multiple image classification;nonattention subspaces;nonlinear subspace;pixel values;pre-computed dictionary subspaces;regular time intervals;sensing visual attention","","0","","18","","","24-28 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, based on the observation that buyers often express opinions openly in free text feedback comments, we propose CommTrust for trust evaluation by mining feedback comments. Our main contributions include: 1) we propose a multidimensional trust model for computing reputation scores from user feedback comments; and 2) we propose an algorithm for mining feedback comments for dimension ratings and weights, combining techniques of natural language processing, opinion mining, and topic modeling.

However, these courses are typically performed in small teams, giving only a limited realistic perspective of problems faced when working in real companies. This paper describes an alternative approach to classic capstone projects, with the aim of being more realistic from an organizational, process, and communication perspective. This methodology, called the company approach, is described by intended learning outcomes, teaching/learning activities, and assessment tasks.

Process of deciding threshold to show any movement in dynamic environment has high enough difficulty related with many “fake” movement which appears as the result of illumination change factor, sunshine or light source, color differences as the effect of automatic color correction inside the device, shadow movement, etc. Temporal mechanism using standard deviation is a mechanism that proposed in Video Surveillance and Monitoring (VSAM) research project at Carniagie Mellon Universitiy. In this research we proposed one hybrid scheme to determine initial value of motion thresholding to create an adaptive moving detection system. We proposed the using of local standard deviation in 3 x 3 pixel area as initial value for mechanism that was defined by Robert et al. This hybrid scheme used moving standard deviation value in each pixel to create adaptive threshold value for motion/ movement detection. The experiment showed that by using local standard deviation as initial value we could achieve balance accuracy for movement and non-movement detection with accuracy propostion 80.00% for video with movement and 90.91% for video without movement.","","","10.1109/ICoICT.2013.6574577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574577","adaptive threshold;motion detection;three frame differencing","Accuracy;Cameras;Digital images;Image resolution;Motion detection;Standards;Testing","image colour analysis;image motion analysis;image segmentation;object detection;statistical analysis;video signal processing;video surveillance","Carniagie Mellon Universitiy;VSAM;adaptive moving detection system;adaptive threshold value;automatic color correction;balance accuracy;color difference;dynamic environment;fake movement;frame difference-automatic threshold;hybrid motion detection;illumination change factor;light source;local standard deviation;motion thresholding;movement detection;pixel area;sequentially ordered frame;shadow movement;sunshine;threshold process;video surveillance and monitoring","","0","","17","","","20-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RRMP calibration is a key task, which involves calibration of tools, workpieces and peripherals. However, state-of-the-art calibration methods and tools lead to hardly predictable system downtime, which impacts the reconfiguration phase. A novel method to perform the workpiece calibration is proposed for the reduction of the reconfiguration efforts in RRMPs.

The composites were manufactured by sandwiching a Mo70-Cu core with copper on either side using a hot-rolling process. The Mo70-Cu core was obtained by using a standard infiltration method used in powder metallurgy. Various process parameters and their influences on the mechanical properties of the composite have been studied. It has been observed that the cracking of the core material during hot-rolling can be improved by optimizing the infiltration time. Also, defects such as microvoids and microcracks could be reduced significantly by optimizing the intermediate anneal temperature of the core material. With an improved core, superior thermal properties could be achieved by joining the composite structures in an appropriate fashion. The optimized manufacturing method resulted in a CPC composite with a density of 9.52 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, thermal conductivity (TC) of 265 W/(m·K), coefficient of thermal expansion of 7.9-9.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup>/K, and a hermeticity, or helium leak rate, of 8.85 × 10<sup>-10</sup> Pa. m<sup>3</sup>/s.

Apart from collisions, many applications benefit from incorporating costs into planning; cost functions or cost maps are a common tool. Similar to checking a single configuration for collision, evaluating its cost using a grid-based cost map also requires examining every cell under the robot footprint. This work gives theoretical and practical insights on how to efficiently check a large number of configurations for collision and cost. As part of this work, configuration space costs are formulated, which can be seen as generalization of configuration space obstacles allowing a complete configuration check incorporating the robot geometry to be done using a single lookup. Furthermore, this paper presents two efficient algorithms for their calculation: FAMOD, an approximate method based on convolution, which is independent of the size and the shape of the robot mask, and vHGW-360, an exact method based on the van Herk-Gil-Werman morphological dilation algorithm, which can be used if the robot shape is rectangular.

However, with increasing train mobility, the resulting large Doppler shift introduces intercarrier interference (ICI) in OFDM systems and greatly degrades channel estimation accuracy. Therefore, it is necessary and important to investigate reliable channel estimation and ICI mitigation methods in high-mobility environments. In this paper, we consider a typical HST communication system and show that the ICI caused by large Doppler shifts can be mitigated by exploiting the train position information and the sparsity of the basis expansion model (BEM)-based channel model. Then, we show that for the complex-exponential BEM (CE-BEM)-based channel model, the ICI can be completely eliminated to get the ICI-free pilots at each receive antenna. After that, we propose a new pilot pattern design algorithm to reduce system coherence to improve the compressed-sensing-based channel estimation accuracy. The proposed optimal pilot pattern is independent of the number of receive antennas, the Doppler shifts, train position, or train speed. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in high-mobility environments. The results also show that the proposed scheme is robust to the speed of the moving train.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2015.2471085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7214298","Channel estimation;compressed sensing (CS);high mobility;intercarrier interference (ICI);orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM);single-input multiple-output (SIMO)","Channel estimation;Channel models;Doppler shift;Frequency-domain analysis;Global Positioning System;OFDM;Receiving antennas","Doppler shift;OFDM modulation;channel estimation;compressed sensing;intercarrier interference;railway communication;receiving antennas;telecommunication network reliability","Doppler shifts;HST communication system;basis expansion model;complex-exponential BEM;compressed-sensing-based channel estimation;high-mobility SIMO-OFDM systems;high-speed train systems;intercarrier interference;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;position-based ICI elimination;receive antennas;train position;train speed","","2","","","","20150820","Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"A Generic Mitigation Framework against Cross-VM Covert Channels","W. Qi; J. Wang; H. Hovhannisyan; K. Lu; J. Wang; J. Zhu","","2016 25th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)","","2016","","","1","10","In recent years, many cross-VM covert channels have been discovered in cloud computing, causing serious security concerns. For such covert channels, some mitigation schemes have been proposed, but usually one mitigation scheme aims at a specific covert channel, which may be inefficient in defending against potential new attacks. In this paper, we propose a generic solution to mitigate the risk of a broad class of timing-based cross-VM covert channels. The design is motivated by our finding that the capacity of most timing-based cross-VM covert channels highly depends on the co-run probability among VMs, where the co-run probability depends not only on how VMs are assigned to servers, but also how VMs are scheduled on a single server, which is related to managing the vCPUs assigned to each VM. We find that the VM co-run probability can be reduced when the number of vCPUs increases, but it also causes extra system overhead in resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a generic VM provisioning and VM scheduling solution to jointly minimize the co-run probability among VMs, meanwhile, maintaining high resource utilization. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed scheduling algorithm can mitigate the risk of timing-based cross-VM covert channel with lower system overhead. We also conduct simulation of VM provisioning which shows that the proposed solution can achieve the balance between high resource utilization and low risk of information leakage caused by cross-VM covert channels.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2279-3; POD:978-1-5090-2280-9","10.1109/ICCCN.2016.7568479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7568479","","Cloud computing;Hardware;Receivers;Scheduling;Security;Servers;Virtual machine monitors","","","","","","","","","1-4 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe a framework called Policy Aware Social Miner (PASM) that would provide a solution to these problems by giving users a way to semantically annotate data on the Web using policies to guide how searches about them should be executed. PASM accepts search queries and applies the user's policies on the results. It filters results over data the user owns and provides the user's refutation link on search results that the user does not own.

Each agent can issue work transactions which comprise a set of tasks that have to be completed by a networked set of servers. The agents get more utilities as their transactions delivery rate increases, however, network administration entails a set of constraints on the tolerable delay on the transactions. An optimization model is constructed to characterize the system in which the available servers are allocated to the present agents. The optimization model is solved in a decentralized way so that the agents can work separately to maximize the global benefit measure of the network.

Empirically grounded in cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience, the LIDA architecture employs a variety of modules and processes, each with its own effective representations and algorithms. LIDA has much to say about motivation, emotion, attention, and autonomous learning in cognitive agents. In this paper, we summarize the LIDA model together with its resulting agent architecture, describe its computational implementation, and discuss results of simulations that replicate known experimental data. We also discuss some of LIDA's conceptual modules, propose nonlinear dynamics as a bridge between LIDA's modules and processes and the underlying neuroscience, and point out some of the differences between LIDA and other cognitive architectures.

In reality, all kinds of sensors monitor every aspect of our life, which provides various services and brings the challenge: how to effectively integrate those distributed sensor resources and then can be used to find more advanced information or implement the sharing of resources are the big problems to be solved. Based on the framework of Sensor Web Enablement(SWE) which was proposed by Open GIS Consortium (OGC)and combined with the function of web crawler, we study and find Sensor Observation Service (SOS) service which is the core components of the SWE then we design a system based on the web crawler technology and the Istituto Scienze della Terra Sensor Observation Service (Istsos) architecture. The design of sensor network technology integration architecture includes three parts. The layer of data access which is the lowest layer encapsulates the access to the database or other source of resources. The layer of business logic it provides the core operation of component which was named Request Operator, this layer is used for processing various requests from the lowest layer in order to return the classes of listening. The layer of web and the client is connected, which can provide some thin client of SOS. The published server includes the ability of new services creation, addition of new sensors and relative metadata, visualization, and manipulation of stored observations, registration of new measures and setting of system properties like observable properties and data quality codes. In order to get sensor data, web crawler technology is used in our research, which can make us get sensor data from the target website, and the standardized sensor data is gotten by filtering the original data and then the data is uploaded to the database of Istsos with the standardized format. At last, the implementation of SOS architec- ure has been configured. The test's results show that the integrated architecture of services can effectively obtain the required sensor data and display them graphically.","2161-024X;2161024X","","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2015.7378670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7378670","Istsos;Sensor Observation Service (SOS);Tomact;sensor network;web crawler","Service-oriented architecture","Web sites;data visualisation;geographic information systems;meta data;software architecture","Istituto Scienze della Terra Sensor Observation Service;Istsos architecture;OGC;Open GIS consortium;SOS architecture;SOS service;SWE;Web crawler technology;Web site;business logic;data access;distributed sensor resource;integration technology;relative metadata;request operator;sensor network technology integration architecture;sensor observation service;sensor system;sensor web enablement;standardized format;standardized sensor data;visualization","","","","7","","","19-21 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we aim to understand the traffic nature of MIM in cellular networks. Specifically, in order to reach credible conclusions, our research takes account of practical measurement records of MIM services from China Mobile at two different levels. First, a data set of individual message level (IML) traffic is exploited and reveals power-law distributed message length and lognormal distributed interarrival time, the heavy-tailness of which completely diverts from the geometric model and the exponential model recommended by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP). Second, another data set considers the statistical pattern of aggregated traffic within one whole base station, and demonstrates the accuracy of α-stable models for the aggregated traffic. Furthermore, it verifies that the α-stable models are suitable for characterizing the traffic in both the conventional fixed core networks and the cellular access networks. At last, with the aid of the generalized central limit theorem, we build up a theoretical relation between the distributions of IML traffic and aggregated traffic.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2468591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7235003","$alpha $ -stable models;Mobile instantaneous messaging;Wechat/Weixin;cellular networks;heavy-tailed distributions;traffic distribution","Data models;Distribution functions;Fitting;Instant messaging;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Random variables","3G mobile communication;cellular radio;electronic messaging;telecommunication traffic","α-stable models;3GPP;3rd generation partnership project;China mobile;IML traffic;MIM services;aggregated traffic;cellular access networks;cellular networks;conventional fixed core networks;individual message level traffic;lognormal distributed interarrival time;mobile instantaneous messaging services;power-law distributed message length;practical measurement records;statistical pattern;traffic nature","","1","","19","","","2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Privacy cannot be achieved without obtaining security practice, nor will the usage of security mechanisms guarantee protection of privacy. Despite being closely linked in practice, privacy and security are perceived as separate issues by online users.

Our study is based on a live scenario, where real traffic measurements of a major European mobile network operator are used. The effects of renewable energy allocation and base stations switching- off are evaluated in terms of on-grid energy saving and electric bill reduction. Moreover, a new algorithm that combines an intelligent renewable energy allocation and a switch-off mechanism based on renewable energy generation, storage state and price of on-grid energy is proposed. Our results show that switching-off bases stations can achieve about 19 % energy demand reduction. Moreover, equipping base stations with renewable energy sources that generate 20 % of the total network energy demand can lead to 51 % reduction in the electric bill.","1550-2252;15502252","","10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7146051","","Base stations;Mobile communication;Power demand;Renewable energy sources;Resource management;Switches;Throughput","energy conservation;mobile radio;renewable energy sources;telecommunication power management","European mobile network operator;base stations switching-off;electric bill reduction;energy-efficient mobile network;on-grid energy saving;renewable energy allocation;renewable energy generation;renewable energy sources;renewable energy usage;traffic measurements","","0","","12","","","11-14 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Media Naturalness and Compensatory Adaptation: Counterintuitive Effects on Correct Rejections of Deceitful Contract Clauses","N. Kock; J. Carmona; M. Moqbel","Division of International Business and Technology Studies, Texas A&M International University, Laredo, Texas, USA","IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication","","2015","58","4","381","395","Research problem: Deciding whether to accept or reject contract clauses in software purchasing contracts is a complex communication-related task, which is likely faced daily by a multitude of software purchasing professionals in a variety of organizations. Research question: What are the effects of viewing contract clauses as video clips, compared to viewing clauses as text only, in terms of cognitive effort, communication ambiguity, and correctness in the acceptance or rejection of clauses in software purchasing contracts? Literature review: The literature on the Media Richness and Media Naturalness theories suggest that viewing contract clauses as video clips should reduce cognitive effort and communication ambiguity. However, while Media Richness theory suggests that correctness in the acceptance or rejection of clauses in software purchasing contracts should increase with the use of video clips, Media Naturalness theory suggests a neutral overall effect. Methodology: An experiment was conducted in which student participants were asked to either accept or reject 20 clauses from a software contract, placing themselves in the position of buyers. Of the 20 clauses, 6 were intentionally deceitful and potentially harmful to the buyer. Approximately half of the participants reviewed the contract clauses as web-based text, and the remaining as web-based video clips. Results and conclusions: Viewing contract clauses as video clips was associated with significantly less cognitive effort and less communication ambiguity than viewing the clauses as text only. Counterintuitively, increases in perceived cognitive effort and communication ambiguity were associated with more successful identification and rejection of deceitful contract clauses. The combination of these competing effects led to an overall neutral effect of the medium on the correctness in the acceptance or rejection of clauses.

It provides an internet connection to broadband coverage area of several kilometers in radius, it's an adequate response to some rural or inaccessible areas. Unlike DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or other wired technology, WiMAX uses radio waves and can provide point-to-multipoint (PMP) and point-to-point (P2P) modes. In parallel, it was observed that in the contrast of the traditional quality evaluation approaches, nowadays, current researches focus on the user perceived quality, the existing scheduling approaches take into account the quality of service (QoS), mobility and many other parameters, but do not consider the quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we develop a scheduling algorithm to provide QoE to the WiMAX network. A novel approach is proposed, especially for the Best Effort (BE) WiMAX service class, in this approach if there has been a packet loss on a connection, the system reduces the transmission rate of this connection, until achieving its minimum allowable transmission rate. Simulation results on NS-2 simulator show that by applying various levels of mean opinion score (MOS) the QoE provided to the users is enhanced in term of throughput, jitter, packet loss rate and delay.","2327-6525;23276525","","10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990226","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990226","BE;NS-2;QoE;QoS;WiMAX","Analytical models;Delays;Jitter;Packet loss;Quality of service;WiMAX","Internet;WiMax;losses;quality of experience;quality of service;telecommunication scheduling","BE WiMAX network service class;DSL;IEEE 802.16 standard;MOS;NS-2 simulator;P2P modes;PMP modes;QoE-based scheduling algorithm;QoS;best effort WiMAX service class;broadband coverage area;delay enhancement;digital subscriber line;inaccessible areas;internet connection;jitter enhancement;mean opinion score;minimum allowable transmission rate;packet loss enhancement;point-to-multipoint modes;point-to-point modes;quality of experience;quality of service;radio waves;rural areas;technical standards;throughput enhancement;transmission rate reduction;user perceived quality;wired technology;worldwide interoperability for microwave access","","0","","19","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially cancellous bone, which is the objective of a new electrostimulative total hip revision system, has a porous, inhomogeneous microstructure. The present work investigates numerically the electric field distribution within this tissue using microscopic computer tomography scans of small bone samples.

Conserved distribution of the number of sides of cells with a mean value of six was found in a variety of proliferating epithelia. Previous studies have shown that clones of proliferating cells bounded by quiescent cells have fewer sides than normal epithelia. However, the mechanisms for mediating such localized topological change remain poorly understood. In this study, we use a two-dimensional vertex model with consideration of mechanical forces to investigate how differential proliferation and forces can influence cell shape and tissue morphogenesis, and how they may lead to distorted topological change. We find that differential proliferation alone is insufficient to affect the topology of boundary proliferating cells. Rather, increased surface tension on the boundary, in addition to differential proliferation, can significantly decrease the average number of cell sides. Our results are consistent with experimental observations. We conclude that mechanical forces in addition to localized differential proliferation are required to produce the distorted topological change which significantly impacts the overall cell shape and tissue morphogenesis.","1094-687X;1094687X","","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6089923","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6089923","","Biological system modeling;Educational institutions;Force;Shape;Stress;Surface tension;Topology","","","Cell Enlargement;Cell Size;Cells, Cultured;Computer Simulation;Epithelial Cells;Humans;Mechanotransduction, Cellular;Models, Biological;Stress, Mechanical","1","","10","","","Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Power plant cycling entails short-term costs, e.g., additional fuel costs during start-up, and long-term costs, e.g., additional maintenance costs. Power plant operators should take long-term cycling costs into account when making short-term scheduling decisions, in order to reduce total generation costs. This paper presents a new approach to consider long-term start-up costs in a short-term unit commitment model. The approach is based on an iterative procedure, in which consecutively a unit commitment model is solved and the correct total start-up cost is recalculated. This new approach, referred to as the Cost Redistribution Unit Commitment (CRUC), is applied to a real-life case study based on the 2014 German electricity system. The performance of the CRUC model, in terms of generation costs and computational tractability, is compared with existing start-up cost formulations in the literature. The simulation results show that, for the considered case study, the CRUC model outperforms the existing formulations in terms of generation costs, but requires a longer run time.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1298-5; POD:978-1-5090-1299-2","10.1109/EEM.2016.7521280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7521280","Power plant cycling;long-term cycling cost;start-up costs;unit commitment","Computational modeling;Fuels;Indexes;Iterative methods;Maintenance engineering;Portfolios;Power generation","optimisation;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation scheduling","conventional power plant cycling;cost redistribution unit commitment;fuel costs;long term cycling costs;maintenance cost;short term unit commitment","","","","","","","6-9 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One approach to alleviate such overheads is to use less flexible logic elements capable to implement majority of logic functions. In this paper, we first investigate the most frequently used functions in standard benchmarks and then design a set of less-flexible but area-efficient logic cells, called Hard Logics (HL). Since higher input functions have diverse classes, we leverage Shannon decomposition to break them into smaller ones to either reduce the HL design space complexity or attain asymmetric low input functions. A heterogeneous LUT-HL architecture and a mapping scheme are also proposed to attain maximum logic resource usage. Experimental results on MCNC benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed architecture reduces area-delay product by 13% and 36% as compared to LUT4 and LUT6 based FPGAs, respectively. Considering the same area budget, our proposed architecture improves performance by 17% and 2% as compared to LUT4 and LUT6 based FPGAs.","1946-147X;1946147X","","10.1109/FPL.2015.7293953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7293953","","Benchmark testing;Delays;Routing;Silicon;Table lookup","computational complexity;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;reconfigurable architectures;table lookup","ASIC;HL design space complexity reduction;LUT4 based FPGA;LUT6 based FPGA;MCNC benchmarks;Shannon decomposition;application-specific integrated circuit;arbitrary function implementation;area budget;area overhead;area-delay product reduces;asymmetric low input functions;field-programmable gate arrays;hard logics;heterogeneous LUT-HL architecture;logic cells;logic elements;logic functions;look-up tables;mapping scheme;maximum logic resource usage;most-frequent logic function characterization;performance improvement;performance overhead;reconfigurable architecture","","1","","16","","","2-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Record encryption mechanism of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [4] with Pre-Shared Key (PSK) [5] is used for encrypted exchange of application layer data. The secure session credentials derived from the application layer is used for encrypted exchange over the transport layer.

There are only a few big e-tailers but there is a long tail of small-sized e-tailers. The big e-tailers are able to collect significant data on user activities at their websites. They use these assets to derive insights about their products and to provide superior experiences for their users. On the other hand, small e-tailers do not possess such user data and hence cannot match the rich user experiences offered by big e-tailers. Our key insight is that web search engines possess significant data on user behaviors that can be used to help smaller e-tailers mine the same signals that big e-tailers derive from their proprietary user data assets. These signals can be exposed as data services in the cloud; e-tailers can leverage them to enable similar user experiences as the big e-tailers. We present three such data services in the paper: entity synonym data service, query-to-entity data service and entity tagging data service. The entity synonym service is an in-production data service that is currently available while the other two are data services currently in development at Microsoft.

Different methods used to model the phase change with convective motion of liquid phase are discussed. First, models based on CFD (computational fluid dynamics) are presented; the solution of Navier-Stokes equations determines the effect of convection in a Newtonian fluid. Secondly, simplified methods are presented, where the convection in the liquid phase change material (PCM) is modeled without the need of the full solution of Navier-Stokes equations. It is clear that the methods based on CFD models are more accurate and express the realistic behavior of the convection effect; however their computational time is very long compared to simplified one.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1864-2; POD:978-1-5090-1865-9","10.1109/REDEC.2016.7577543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577543","CFD;PCM;convection;enhanced conduction;enthalpy methods","Conductivity;Convection;Liquids;Mathematical model;Phase change materials;Solids","","","","","","","","","13-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In countries where no standard form of identification is available, this problem is exacerbated by a lack of literacy and also frequent errors in spelling and consistency. To address this need, we implemented two low-cost hand vein scanner devices for use with mobile devices. The first scanner device employs the internal camera of the an Android smart phone along with a rechargeable infrared light (850nm) and an external optical filter; and the second scanner device employs a low-cost webcam, with integrated LEDs (940nm) and optical filter, which is powered directly from the Android tablet. A single mobile app was developed for use with both scanner devices with the ability to adjust scanner settings, capture hand palm images, and annotate patient data. As an initial test of our scanner designs, we collected hand scans from 51 university students aged 18-34 using an IRB-approved protocol, and data was processed using a 2D-PCA biometric algorithm implemented on a PC using MATLAB software. Using the standard FAR-FRR curve for biometric analysis, we were able to achieve an Equivalent Error Rate (EER) of 6.3% for the phone camera scanner, and 4.2% for the webcam scanner design. These results compare favorably with other published biometrics studies and demonstrate the potential of low-cost biometric devices that can be integrated with mobile phones and tablets.","","","10.1109/GHTC.2014.6970336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6970336","biometrics;identification;mobile;smart phone;tablet;webcam","Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Optical filters;Veins;Webcams","cameras;medical image processing;mobile computing;optical scanners;principal component analysis;smart phones;vein recognition","2D-PCA biometric algorithm;Android smart phone;Android tablet;EER;IRB-approved protocol;LEDs;Matlab software;PC;Webcam scanner design;equivalent error rate;external optical filter;global health patient identification;hand palm images;health services;internal camera;low-cost Webcam;low-cost hand vein scanner devices;mobile devices;mobile-based hand vein biometric analysis;patient data annotation;phone camera scanner;rechargeable infrared light;single mobile app;standard FAR-FRR curve;wavelength 850 nm;wavelength 940 nm","","0","","28","","","10-13 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Contrary to GPS, it effectively penetrates buildings, contrary to 3G/4G or TV, FM radio receivers are becoming freely available in mobile devices. Indeed, nearly every smart phone and many other consumer electronics today have a built-in FM chip. In this paper, we demonstrate that this ubiquitous in-the-air and on-device FM radio availability presents a unique opportunity to address some of the fundamental wireless networking problems. In particular, we focus on the problem commonly arising in home networks where devices from neighboring, yet autonomous and non-collaborative, Wi-Fi networks systematically ""step on each other's feet"", i.e., interfere and degrade each other's performance. We show that the digital signal that accompanies broadcast FM radio has sufficient structure to enable effective scheduling relative to it. It thus provides a common reference for neighboring devices to harmonize their transmissions, yet without requiring any explicit communication among them. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first to enable such mutually-beneficial, autonomous, and implicit harmonization among Wi-Fi devices across administrative network bounds.","1092-1648;10921648","","10.1109/ICNP.2015.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7437115","","Encoding;Frequency modulation;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Mobile handsets;Synchronization;Wireless networks","smart phones;wireless LAN","FM chip;FM radio receivers;Wi-FM;Wi-Fi networks;administrative network bounds;autonomous harmonization;consumer electronics;digital signal;frequency 87.5 MHz to 108 MHz;fundamental wireless networking problems;home networks;implicit harmonization;mobile devices;neighborhood wireless network affairs;smart phone","","","","40","","","10-13 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Determining the DNA of an individual organism is performed through a process called DNA sequencing. Although several different sequencing technologies do exist, they are limited and are able to acquire relatively short sequence reads. One of the approaches to sequencing involves randomly breaking a long DNA molecule into small fragments and sequencing only those fragments. Due to the random positioning of fragments on the source DNA, majority of them overlap, and provide the necessary information to combine them back together. The process of reconstructing the original DNA sequence from fragment reads is called DNA assembly. Assembly is a computationally very intensive process that may take days, or even weeks to produce the sequence of a more complex organism. Reconstructing a DNA sequence in the absence of a previously reconstructed reference sequence from a similar organism is called de novo assembly. De novo assembly methods currently provide the only means to discover new, previously unknown sequences, and are currently indispensable in biological research. In this paper, short descriptions of the sequencing process and the current sequencing platforms are given. DNA assembly process is thoroughly described, and the analysis of several de novo approaches used for assembly are presented. Overview and description of existing software tools are given, including some parallel implementations. As a conclusion, aspects of possible future development of DNA assembly are considered.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6596281","DNA sequencing;assembly;consensus;de Bruijn;layout;overlap;parallel","Assembly;Bioinformatics;DNA;Genomics;Layout;Sequential analysis;Solids","DNA;biology computing","DNA assembly process;DNA de novo assembly;DNA molecule;DNA sequencing;assembly;biological research;complex organism;individual organism","","0","","54","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most appreciated feature of a learning game is to provide in an automatic way to each learner an integrated feedback in real time during the game and, ideally, a personally meaningful debriefing at the end of each session. Immersive learning games use virtual reality and 3D environments to allow several learners at once to collaborate in the most natural way. Managing the communication on the other hand has proven so far a more difficult problem to overcome. In this article, we present a communication system designed to be used in immersive learning games. This innovative system is neither based on voice-chat nor branching dialogues but on the idea that pieces of information can be manipulated as tangible objects in a virtual environment. This system endeavours to offer the simplest and most intuitive way for several learners to acquire and share knowledge in an immersive virtual environment while complying with the requirements of a reliable assessment of their performance. A first experiment with nurse anaesthetist students gives evidence that this simple communication system is apt to support lifelike behaviours such as consultation, debate, conflict or irritation.","","","10.1109/VS-GAMES.2015.7295768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7295768","","Collaboration;Communication systems;Context;Games;Real-time systems;Surgery;Virtual environments","computer based training;computer games;virtual reality","3D environments;branching dialogues;communication system;highly technical jobs;immersive learning games;immersive virtual environment;knowledge sharing;professional training;real-life simulations;virtual reality;voice-chat","","","","14","","","16-18 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In heart surgery, the heart is stopped as it is too difficult for the surgeon to follow the heart's beating motion and perform a surgical task. In radiation therapy, respiration causes the cancerous tissue to move, rendering the therapy less effective and possibly damaging to healthy tissue. This paper focuses on controlling a robot, which is used to perform the surgery or therapy, to compensate for the physiological motion along the surgical tool's axis such that the point of interest (POI) on the organ becomes stationary relative to the robot. The difficulty in creating such a system lies in the measurement of the POI's and robot's positions via different sensors that are unregistered, have different measurement rates, and have data acquisition and processing delays. This paper presents the Kalman-filter-based estimation of the organ motion despite the large data acquisition/processing delays and low update rates inherent in some measurements used for robot control in robot-assisted surgeries and therapies. This paper also proposes control systems that compensate for the organ motion despite the delayed, multirate, and unregistered sensor data allowing the physician to perform a therapeutic or surgical procedure with a teleoperated robot on a seemingly stationary POI.","1083-4435;10834435","","10.1109/TMECH.2015.2482391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7277085","","Delays;Heart;Position measurement;Robot sensing systems;Surgery","","","","","","31","","20150925","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, the EtherCAT library does not seem to be able to guarantee a high degree of determinism. In this paper, first the real-time performance of the user space implementation of the EtherCAT master is evaluated and compared with the one that can be obtained by implementing the same control application at the kernel level.

Furthermore, all the switches can achieve ZVS soft-switching performance at any load condition by adopting the active clamp circuits and the PWM plus phase shift (PPS) control strategy. Thus, the BDC can operate at high frequency to achieve high power density and still with high efficiency for high voltage dc bus applications.

In grid connected mode of operation, energy not supplied can be further reduced by interregional V2G, which allows energy exchange among load points through healthy mains and laterals by sectionalizing the failure parts of the grid. Evaluation methods are proposed to determine the capacity contribution of EVs for each scenario.

This definition is challenged through the presented analysis of more than 100 success stories which are offered by vendors of Big Data technology and solutions. By applying elements of the grounded theory method, the paper goes beyond an overview. The property of variety (which seems to be of particular interest) and structures of the outcome of Big Data projects are discussed. A major implication is that there is a crucial difference between Big Data use cases incorporating all 3Vs and those incorporating less. When all three properties are involved, a new phenomenon arises from embracing new data sources that are within and beyond the organizational borders.","1530-1605;15301605","","10.1109/HICSS.2015.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069692","","Big data;Data models;Encoding;Market research;Media;Organizations","Big Data","3V;Big Data projects;Big Data use cases;data sources;grounded theory method;industrial success stories;volume-variety-and-velocity","","1","","47","","","5-8 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve that, we propose a Bayesian based singular value decomposition (BSVD) and its related inference algorithms in this study. Specifically, we impose a T assumption on the ratings and the feature vectors, and propose a Gibbs sampler for the inference part.

However, these ad modules often collect users' personal information and device identification numbers along with usage statistics, which is a violation of privacy. In our analysis of 1,188 Android applications' network traffic, we identified 797 applications that included 45 previously known ad modules. We analyzed these ad modules' network behavior, and found that they have characteristic network traffic patterns for acquiring ad content, specifically images. In order to accurately differentiate between ad modules' network traffic and valid application network traffic, we propose a novel method based on the distance between network traffic graphs mapping the relationships between HTTP session data (such as HTML or Java Script). This distance describes the similarity between the sessions. Using this method, we can detect ad modules' traffic by comparing session graphs with the graphs of already known ad modules. In our evaluation, we generated 20,903 graphs of applications. We separated the application graphs into those generated by known ad modules (4,698 graphs), those we manually identified as ad modules (2,000 graphs), and standard application traffic. We then applied 1,000 graphs of known ad graphs to the other graph sets (the remaining 3,698 known ad graphs and the 2,000 manually classified ad graphs) to see how accurately they could be used to identify ad graphs. Our approach showed a 76% detection rate for known ad graphs, and a 96% detection rate for manually classified ad graphs.","","","10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2014.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023192","Android;Network Security;Privacy;Smartphone","Androids;Google;HTML;Humanoid robots;Privacy;Servers;Uniform resource locators","hypermedia;network theory (graphs);smart phones;transport protocols","Android application;HTTP session data;advertisement module network behavior;graph modelling;network traffic pattern","","1","","34","","","3-5 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such an increase makes the application of image fusion techniques in remote sensing important. However, the interrelationship between the two fields is not well-understood. In fact, the term “image fusion” in remote sensing has usually been limited to one application only, that is pan-sharpening. Image fusion, however, is much broader and can be applied to serve different purposes within the field of remote sensing. This paper aims to show where pan-sharpening fits within the image fusion paradigm, to present some other applications of image fusion in remote sensing, and to highlight the advantages that image fusion can provide.","","","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2012.6207718","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6207718","Pixel-level image fusion;data fusion;image fusion;image processing;pan-sharpening;remote sensing;signal processing","Feature extraction;Image fusion;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spatial resolution","image fusion;remote sensing","image fusion;imagery data;pan-sharpening;pixel-level fusion;remote sensing","","1","","27","","","18-20 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Energy Management Strategy for Supercapacitor in Droop-controlled DC Microgrid Using Virtual Impedance","Y. Zhang; Y. W. Li","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2016","PP","99","1","1","With a proper energy management strategy (EMS), supercapacitor (SC) can be integrated into droop-controlled DC microgrid as an independent supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS). The resulted microgrid could supply repeatedly quick bursts of electrical power due to load or source transients and improve power quality and lifetime of other distributed generations (DGs) or distributed energy storages. In this paper, a novel control strategy for SCESS is proposed. The method uses the virtual impedance loop to add a virtual resistor and a virtual capacitor connected in series between the converter and DC bus, which decouples power flow between SCESS and other DGs while ensuring the plug’n’play feature. The results show that the proposed EMS has a competing dynamic performance with excellent flexibility as compared to existing methods.","0885-8993;08858993","","10.1109/TPEL.2016.2571308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7478044","Distributed generation (DG);droop-controlled DC microgrid;supercapacitor;virtual impedance","Energy management;Energy storage;Impedance;Microgrids;Surges;Transient analysis;Voltage control","","","","","","","","20160524","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These markers form a new diagnosis tool “NAT” aiming at characterizing various brain disorders. Each signal sequence is divided into segments of 0.64 s and its discrete PS consists of eleven frequency components from 4.68 (3 × 1.56) Hz through 20.34 (13 × 1.56) Hz. PS is normalized to its mean and the bias of PS components on each frequency component across the 21 signal channels is reset to zero. The marker sNAT consists often frequency components on 21 channels, characterizing neuronal hyperactivity or hypoactivity as compared with NLc (normal controls). The marker vNAT consists of ten ratios between adjacent PS components denoting the over- or undersynchrony of collective neuronal activities as compared with NLc. The likelihood of a test subject to a specified brain disease is defined in terms of the normalized distance to the template NAT state of the disease in the NAT space. Separation of MCI-AD patients (developing AD in 12-18 months) from NLc is made with a false alarm rate of 15%. Locations with neuronal hypoactivity and undersynchrony of AD patients agree with locations of rCBF reduction measured by SPECT. The 2D diagram composed of the binary likelihoods between ADc and NLc in the two representations of sNAT and vNAT enables tracing the NAT state of a test subject approaching the AD area, and the follow-up of the treatment effects.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2013.2255101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6492242","Alzheimer's disease;electroencephalogram (EEG);likelihood;neuronal activity;power spectral","Diseases;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Modulation;Neurons;Sensitivity;Single photon emission computed tomography","biomedical electrodes;diseases;electroencephalography;medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;single photon emission computed tomography;spectral analysis","2D diagram;EEG markers;MCI-AD patient;NAT space;NLc;PS component bias;SPECT;adjacent PS component;anomalous activity characterization;binary likelihood;biomedical electrode;brain disease;cerebral neuron;collective neuronal activity oversynchrony;collective neuronal activity undersynchrony;diagnosis tool;discrete PS;electroencephalogram power spectra;frequency 4 Hz to 20 Hz;frequency component;marker sNAT;marker vNAT;neuronal activity topography method;neuronal hyperactivity;neuronal hypoactivity;normal control;rCBF reduction;signal channel;signal segmentation;signal sequence;template NAT state;time 0.64 s;time 5 min","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Brain;Brain Diseases;Brain Mapping;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Humans;Nerve Net;Neurons;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","3","","23","","20130402","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The simulation focused on three levels of IM clearance complexity and two different modes of communication (voice only versus voice and CPDLC). In the HITL, pilots and controllers conducted IM and had communication exchanges that were supported by automation. Controller results from the HITL are provided in this paper. The majority of controllers found the integration of the IM and CPDLC capabilities acceptable.

In this paper, a formal model is proposed for the application of SOAs in the distributed automation domain in order to achieve flexible automation systems. Practical scenarios of applying SOA in industrial automation are discussed. In order to support the SOA IEC 61499 model, a service-based execution environment architecture is proposed.

The calculations indicate that both Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl and GeTe-doped Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl are half-magnetic ferromagnets. The Fermi energy (E<sub>F</sub>) of GeTe-doped Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl is located in the middle of the gap of the minority states instead of around the top of the valence band as in Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl. Moreover, the bandgap of GeTe-doped Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl (1.01 eV) is much wider than that of Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl (0.74 eV). These improved electronic structures will make GeTe-doped Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl more stable against temperature variation. As for the magnetic properties, it was found that the substitution of GeTe for Al results in an increase in magnetic moment. The calculation results show that after doped with GeTe, the Fe-Fe distance in the Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl cell becomes larger, which results in a stronger exchange interaction and consequently a larger magnetization density, leading to the increase in magnetic moment. Therefore, the expected excellent stability, wider bandgap, and larger magnetic moment of the GeTe-doped Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl make it more suitable for spintronic applications than Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl.","0018-9464;00189464","","10.1109/TMAG.2015.2440395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116540","Co2FeAl;GeTe-doped;Half-metallic;half metallic","Doping;Iron;Magnetic moments;Magnetic properties;Temperature;Thermal stability","Fermi level;ab initio calculations;aluminium alloys;cobalt alloys;density functional theory;doping;energy gap;exchange interactions (electron);ferromagnetic materials;germanium compounds;iron alloys;magnetic moments;valence bands","Co<sub>2</sub>FeAl:GeTe;Fe-Fe distance;Fermi energy;GeTe-doping;Heusler alloys;band gap;electronic properties;electronic structures;exchange interaction;first-principles calculations;half-magnetic ferromagnets;half-metallic stability;local spin-density approximation;magnetic moment;magnetic properties;magnetization density;minority states;spintronic applications;temperature variation;valence band","","0","","21","","20150602","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thermal behavior of complicated systems like packaged electronic systems may exhibit nonlinear and temperature dependent properties. As a result, it is difficult to use a low order linear model to approximate the thermal behavior of the packaged integrated systems without accuracy loss. In this paper, we try to mitigate this problem by using piecewise linear (PWL) approach to characterizing the thermal behavior of those systems. The new method (called ThermSubPWL), which is the first proposed approach to nonlinear thermal modeling problem, identifies the linear local models for different temperature ranges using the subspace identification method. A linear transformation method is proposed to transform all the identified linear local models to the common state basis to build the continuous piecewise linear model. Experimental results validate the proposed method on a realistic packaged integrated system modeled via the multi-domain/physics commercial tool, COMSOL, under practical power signal inputs. The new piecewise models can lead to much smaller model order without accuracy loss, which translates to significant savings in both the simulation time and the time required to identify the reduced models compared to applying the high order models.","2153-6961;21536961","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509589","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509589","","Accuracy;Data models;Electronic packaging thermal management;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Power grids;Temperature distribution","integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit packaging;piecewise linear techniques;thermal analysis;thermal management (packaging)","COMSOL;ThermSubPWL method;compact nonlinear thermal modeling;continuous piecewise linear model;linear local model;linear transformation method;packaged electronic systems;packaged integrated systems;piecewise linear method;practical power signal input;subspace identification method;thermal behavior;thermal nonlinear modeling technique","","2","","16","","","22-25 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the potential advantages of a converged network, its performance needs further improvement, especially at cell edges and rural areas where only one network is available. In this article, we investigate how to leverage device-to-device, D2D, communication to further improve the performance of a converged network which consists of an LTE-A cellular network and IEEE 802.11n WLANs. Three main technical challenges that complicate resource allocation are identified: allocation of resources capturing diverse radio access technologies of the networks, selection of users' communication modes for multiple networks to maximize hop and reuse gains, and interference management. To address these challenges, we propose a resource allocation scheme that performs mode selection, allocation of WLAN resources, and allocation of LTE-A network resources in three different timescales. The resource allocation scheme is semi-distributedly implemented in the underlying converged D2D communication network, and the achievable performance improvements are demonstrated via simulation results.","1536-1284;15361284","","10.1109/MWC.2014.7000977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000977","","Complexity theory;Interference;Mobile communication;Quality of service;Resource management;Throughput;Wireless LAN","Long Term Evolution;cellular radio;radio access networks;radiofrequency interference;resource allocation;wireless LAN","D2D communication network;IEEE 802.11n WLAN;LTE-A cellular network;LTE-A network resources;WLAN resource allocation;converged heterogeneous networks;device-to-device communication;heterogeneous wireless networks;interference management;interworking mechanisms;mode selection;radio access technologies;resource allocation;resource allocation scheme;wireless service demand","","4","","15","","","December 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

MTC is related to high number of devices; which represents a challenge when performing control and signaling procedures required for getting resource grant, since these processes are inefficient compared to the actual resource usage for small data transmissions. Solutions based on device grouping propose a static grouping approach, which does not perform well in low load scenario. This paper introduces the notion of a flexible admission/connection that can give granular group device control to Core network. With the proposed approach devices can be grouped for a certain period of time under supervision and control of a gateway and they can be ungrouped when there is no need for grouping them together. In this way, a finer control can be achieved on prioritizing certain services and load balancing. Our simulation results demonstrate significant signaling reduction by using this simple scheme compared to conventional connection procedure.","","","10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7343500","LTE;LTE-Advanced;M2M;MTC;admission control;capillary networks;cluster;control signaling;dynamic group;signaling overload","Admission control;Delays;Land mobile radio;Logic gates;Long Term Evolution;Performance evaluation","Long Term Evolution;group theory;resource allocation;telecommunication control;telecommunication signalling","LTE network;Long Term Evolution;MTC;data transmission;flexible capillary admission control;gateway;granular group device control;load balancing;machine-type communication;signaling overload reduction;static grouping approach","","","","18","","","Aug. 30 2015-Sept. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Autonomic systems are usually composed of different components, which collaborate to achieve a global goal or to provide a high-level service. The collaboration pattern is usually defined statically, but the aim of this paper is to show that there are motivations to enable composed systems to change their collaboration pattern at runtime in an autonomous way, starting from some case studies. This capability of autonomic systems is called self-expression, meaning that a system can express itself despite unexpected situations. Moreover, we propose three perspective solutions that aim at enabling the change at runtime: role-based, description based, and Artificial Immune Systems (AIS)-inspired.","","","10.1109/WAINA.2013.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550532","Autonomic computing;collaboration","Autonomic systems;Collaboration;Immune system;Robot kinematics;Runtime;Space exploration","distributed processing;object-oriented methods;software fault tolerance","AIS;artificial immune systems-inspired;autonomic systems;collaboration patterns;description based perspective;distributed systems;role-based perspective;runtime change;self-expression","","3","","15","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To avoid a daunting number of measurements during subjective experiments, a model for visibility thresholds is developed. The left image and right image of a stereo pair are then compressed jointly using the visibility thresholds obtained from the proposed model to ensure that quantization errors in each image are imperceptible to both eyes. This methodology is then demonstrated via a particular 3D stereoscopic display system with an associated viewing condition.

Recently, there has been an increased emphasis on parametric yield issues, referred to as electrical-DFM (e-DFM). In this paper, we present a complete e-DFM solution that detects, analyzes, and fixes electrical hotspots (e-hotspots) within an analog circuit design that are caused by different process variations. Novel algorithms are proposed to implement the engines used to develop this solution. The solution is examined on a 130-nm parametrically-failing level shifter circuit, and verified with silicon wafer measurements that confirm the existence of parametric yield issues in the design. Additional experiments are applied on a 65-nm industrial operational amplifier and voltage control oscillator (VCO). E-hotspot devices with a 27.7% variation in dc current are identified. After fixing the e-hotspots, the dc current variation in these devices is dramatically reduced to 7%, which meets the designer acceptance criteria, while saving the original VCO specifications.","1063-8210;10638210","","10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2201759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6275517","Design-for-manufacturability (DFM);electrical design for manufacturability (e-DFM);parametric yield;process variations","Databases;Engines;Layout;Lithography;SPICE;Stress;Transistors","VLSI;amplifiers;analogue circuits;design for manufacture;failure analysis;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit yield;nanotechnology;network synthesis;semiconductor industry;voltage control","VCO specification;VLSI technology;analog circuit design;catastrophic failure;dc current variation;design for manufacturing;designer acceptance criteria;e-DFM solution;e-hotspots;electrical hotspots;electrical-DFM;electrical-driven hotspot detection;hotspot analysis;hotspot correction;industrial operational amplifier;parametric DFM solution;parametric yield issues;parametrically-failing level shifter circuit;physical DFM problem;process variation;semiconductor industry;silicon wafer measurement;voltage control oscillator;yield failure","","3","","33","","20120820","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Sarwat","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","","2016","63","10","6613","6622","A direct three-phase ac-ac matrix converter for inductive power transfer (IPT) systems with soft-switching operation is introduced. The proposed topology is expected to have a high reliability and extended lifetime due to the soft-switching operation and elimination of short-life electrolytic capacitors. The soft-switching operation will also reduce switching stress, switching loss, and electromagnetic interference of the converter. A variable-frequency control strategy based on the energy-injection and free-oscillation technique is used to regulate the resonant current, the resonant voltage, and the output power. With the use of reverse-blocking switches, the proposed converter can be built with a reduced number of switches (only seven), which will consequently increase the reliability and efficiency and reduce the cost of the converter. The converter operates in eight modes, which are described in detail. With the use of the proposed converter as the primary converter, simulation analysis and experimental implementations on a case study IPT system show that the current regulation control method can fully regulate the output current and output power around user-defined reference values, thus making it suitable for dynamic IPT applications, where the system has inherent variations.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2016.2563408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7465787","AC–AC converter;inductive power transfer (IPT);matrix converter;soft switching","Current control;Frequency conversion;Matrix converters;Oscillators;Switches;Topology;Voltage control","AC-AC power convertors;electric current control;frequency control;inductive power transmission;matrix convertors;switching convertors;voltage control","IPT systems;current regulation control method;electromagnetic interference;energy-injection;free-oscillation technique;inductive power transfer systems;output power regulation;resonant current regulation;resonant voltage regulation;reverse-blocking switches;short-life electrolytic capacitors;single-stage three-phase AC-AC matrix converter;soft-switching operation;switching loss reduction;switching stress reduction;variable-frequency control strategy","","","","","","20160505","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We can evaluate them using a quantitative model. For this purpose, we begin the analysis of touchless hand gestures based on significant gesture features. From the large number of possible features we selected the length and the directions of trajectory. We propose to use the quantity of distance units and directions for describing and quantifying gestures. Moreover, we found that well-defined changes of directions (or corners) influence the speed for performing a gesture, thus users need more time to execute the gesture. Additionally, a model was developed using these three features. The model allows estimating the difficulty of gestures before users testing.","1548-0992;15480992","","10.1109/TLA.2014.6716487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6716487","Gesture Analysis;Gesture Interfaces;Human-Computer Interaction;Natural User Interfaces","Atmospheric modeling;Gesture recognition;Human computer interaction;Predictive models;Software engineering;User interfaces","gesture recognition;human computer interaction","difficulty estimation;human body gestures;human-computer interaction;natural user interface;quantitative model;touchless hand gestures;users testing","","0","","","","","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A small-signal analysis is carried out using the aggregated responses of the generators and the DLC-enabled buildings to investigate the proposed GFR scheme, particularly with respect to the feedback controllers for the buildings. Simulation studies are performed using a test grid for various penetrations of the DLC-enabled buildings, and the test grid is implemented using a laboratory -scale microgrid.

During steady state operation of the electric motor, the electric motor's optimal motor flux profile minimizes the electric motor losses and maximizes the overall HEV efficiency, hybridization factor (HF). During steady state operation of the direct torque controlled (DTC) induction motor, loss minimization is achieved by adjusting the magnitude of the stator flux reference as a function of the vehicle driver (pedal acceleration) and the coordinated control. The proposed stator flux optimization method initially uses a Loss Model Controller (LMC) which provides the real time fast gross approximation of the optimum motor flux and sequential uses a real time fuzzy logic search controller (FLSC). The FLSC control system, provides the real-time refinement of the motor's flux adjustment on the basis of search during the steady states. Due to the FLSC the electric motor's flux level fluctuates in steps until the measurement of electric motor's input electric power settles at a minimum. The dynamic model of the electric motor and the suggested control algorithm designed by using the MATLAB/Fuzzy Logic Toolbox®. The control algorithm is validated by numerical results by using the digital signal processor of eZdspF2812<sup>TM</sup>.

By submerging all of a server's heat-generating components in a dielectric liquid, creates the attack on reliability issues at the device level. The improved efficiency of mineral oil may offer simplicity in facility design compared to traditional air cooling and provide a means for cost savings. In spite of its improved cooling efficiency and cost savings, a mineral oil immersion cooling technique is still not widely implemented and suppliers are reluctant to jeopardize sales of existing air-based cooling system equipment. Only compelling physics regarding direct immersion cooling is not enough for data center operators. Many uncertainties and concerns persist regarding the effects of mineral oil immersion cooling on information technology equipment reliability. The paper presents useful information regarding the influence of mineral oil on the mechanical properties as well as chemical properties of a material. The changes in properties of mineral oil like kinematic viscosity and dielectric strength are also cited as an important factor and discussed briefly. The changes in mechanical properties like elasticity, hardness, swelling, and creep are being shown in the paper for thermoplastic materials. The chemical reaction between material and mineral oil as a function of time and temperature is also conferred. These are significant factors which are responsible for the reliability and compatibility of a material. The changes or modifications in materials of important parts in physical and chemical manner are also indicated. The relations between different dielectric oils and different materials provide us a comparative analysis for reliability and performance. Oil immersion cooling of data cen- ers offers opportunities for enhanced reliability with even temperature conditions in operations as it minimizes common operational issues like: overheating and temperature swings in the system, fan failures in servers, noise, dust, air quality, corrosion, electrochemical migration, and whiskers will also be addressed. The reliability improvements are comprised of the reduction in corrosion & electrochemical migration like corrosive exposure and moisture reduction, reduction in environmental contamination like dust, debris and particulate reduction, stable and even thermal environment and tin and zinc whisker mitigation. These may lead to infer the significance of oil cooled data centers towards performance and savings in operating cost as per reliability aspect.

The designed test vehicle emulates an application processor package for smart mobile applications, and enables for the first time measurements of DC signal transmission from the die to the board, through the package, at this density and pitch. A daisy chain test die, 10 mm × 10 mm in size, was designed to emulate a logic processor chip comprising 5448 I/Os distributed in four peripheral rows at 40/80 μm pitch and a central area array at 150 μm pitch. The test dies were fabricated and bumped with standard Cu pillars by ASE. The glass package design included four routing layers, with blind vias (BVs) and TPVs both at 150 μm pitch, to connect 176 I/Os to the board, with BGAs at 400μm pitch. Independent multi-level test structures were added for evaluation of TPV and BV yield during fabrication, as well as partial chip-and board-level interconnection yield and reliability. The TPVs in glass were achieved by a via-first process with a high-throughput plasma etching and primer drilling method. Semi-additive processes (SAP), combined with wet chemical surface treatment methods were applied for patterning of the multi-layer wiring with a minimum of 20 μm Cu trace width at 40 μm pitch. A fan-in fan-out finger design was implemented on the top layer for bump-on-trace chip-level interconnections. Chip assembly on glass panels was carried out by high-speed thermocompression bonding with non-conductive paste (TC-NCP) with the new high-performance APAMA chip-to-substrate (C2S) bonder by Kulicke and Soffa.

This paper proposes a solution to rapidly react to network bursts and turn-on sleeping links, which we term as SegmenT Routing based Energy Efficient Traffic Engineering for switching ON (STREETE-ON).

While the ΣΔ ADC technology are easily realized in FPGA by signal processing algorithms the major sections of the digital system, such as auto gain control and phase-lock loop are also implemented in FPGA, which have provided the programmable flexibility of the whole system.

SWIM provides a mechanism for National Airspace System (NAS) and non-NAS consumers to have access to FAA-generated aeronautical, flight, and weather information. SWIM is based on a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) framework and promotes the sharing and reuse of software components in the form of published services. Currently, SWIM provides services that make it possible for consumers to obtain various types of data. For example, Traffic Flow Management (TFM) Data provides flight-related information, Integrated Terminal Weather Service (ITWS) provides terminal weather information, and Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) Distribution Service (NDS) publishes aeronautical information. By providing such data, SWIM creates new opportunities for collaboration with industry to drive innovation and create an enhanced user experience. This paper will focus on the consumption of SWIM services from one consumer's perspective, that is, The MITRE Corporation (MITRE). MITRE is a SWIM consumer which is external to the FAA and requires SWIM data for research, data-driven analytics, trend studies, and prototype development. MITRE has developed an architecture to access SWIM data feeds, and re-publish the feeds for internal MITRE development and analysis. This paper will also discuss the process of transitioning to FAA SWIM data feeds and staging SWIM data for use by MITRE systems. Finally, the paper will discuss how MITRE implemented the architecture, which may provide lessons and benefits for other SWIM consumers.","","","10.1109/ICNSURV.2016.7486318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7486318","","FAA;Feeds;Information exchange;Meteorology;Security;Service-oriented architecture;XML","air traffic;information management","Federal Aviation Administration;MITRE Corporation;NAS consumers;National Airspace System;Next Generation Air Transportation System;NextGen FAA;SOA framework;SWIM consumer implementation;key transformational information exchange program;nonNAS consumers;prototype development;service-oriented architecture framework;software component reuse;software component sharing;system wide information management","","","","","","","19-21 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, an absolute displacement sensor has proposed to be utilized as feedback sensors of semiconductor exposure apparatuses. The proposed displacement sensor has the same mechanical structured having a detector and pendulum as a commercial velocity sensor. In previous works, the proposed sensor is applied as feedback and feedforward sensors. However, detection bandwidth is limited due to mechanical resonances called high frequency dynamics. In this paper, causes of the resonances are identified and we carry out to suppress the resonances. At first, control structure and operating principle of the proposed sensor are described. Next, we carry out experimental modal analysis and suppress the resonances by using viscoelastic materials.

Using fast feature extraction from streaming data that can be implemented on the sensor nodes, we show that on-sensor event classification can be achieved. This approach is of particular interest for wireless sensor networks as it promises to reduce wireless traffic significantly, as only events need to be transmitted instead of potentially large chunks of inertial data. The presented approach characterizes the essence of an event's signal by combining several simple features on low-cost MEMS inertial data. Using a scenario and real data from vibration signatures generated by passing trains, we show how with this approach the classification of passing trains is possible on miniature nodes placed near the railroad tracks. Experiments show that, at the cost of slightly more local processing, the chosen features produce good train type classification with up to 90% of trains correctly identified.","","","10.1109/INSS.2012.6240520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240520","event classification;feature extraction;sensor data abstraction;wireless sensor networks","Accelerometers;Data mining;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Vibrations;Wireless sensor networks","feature extraction;inertial systems;microsensors;signal classification;wireless sensor networks","MEMS inertial data;fast feature extraction;on-sensor event classification;passing train classification;resource constrained sensing device;sporadic phenomena;streaming data;trainspotting;wireless sensor network","","1","","14","","","11-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The zero current switching (ZCS) on of this switch is achieved by using transformer leakage inductor, thus no additional components are needed. Furthermore, the power loss of another main switch is minimized by operating it in the Synchronous Rectification mode.

However, these results were almost always uniquely concerned with penetrable media. In this contribution, it will be shown how the integrals can be treated in highly conductive media as well. The rapid exponential decline of the Green's function, due to the losses, is the root of all additional complexities. The method as presented here takes care of these problems in a scalable way, i.e. the computation time becomes independent of the conductivity of the material.

Nerves control the muscles in the body with electrical signals called impulses. These impulses make the muscles react in specific ways. Nerve and muscle problems cause the muscles to react in abnormal ways. Following initial automated self-calibration and positional localization processes, measurement and interpretation of muscle generated electrical signals is accomplished by sampling signals from the EMG sensors of the Wearable Electromyography Device.

"A Generalized Rectangular Cavity Approach for Determination of Complex Permittivity of Materials","A. K. Jha; M. J. Akhtar","Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India","IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","","2014","63","11","2632","2641","A novel cavity-based unified approach to measure the complex permittivity of dielectric samples placed in the E-plane of a rectangular cavity is presented. The proposed generalized cavity method is not limited to test specimens of smaller electrical dimensions, and requires two basic steps. The first step modifies the conventional cavity perturbation technique, where the effects of possible air gap between the cavity slot and the test specimen are also considered. The second step of the proposed approach employs a numerical optimization scheme, where the actual 3-D geometry of the fabricated cavity is simulated using the numerical field simulator, the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio. The dielectric properties of the test specimen in this case are determined with the help of a MATLAB-based optimization routine, which calls the CST modules over the component object model interface and minimizes the error between the measured and the simulated scattering coefficients. The permittivity of the test specimen determined using the first step is provided as the initial guess to improve the convergence of the numerical optimization scheme. The proposed unified approach is validated by designing two rectangular cavities having different slot sizes operating in the TE107 mode. A number of standard dielectric samples are measured with the help of a vector network analyzer, and a very good agreement is observed between the measured permittivity values and the published data available in the literature having a typical error of less than 2% for samples of even larger dimensions.","0018-9456;00189456","","10.1109/TIM.2014.2313415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797881","Cavity perturbation technique;complex permittivity;dielectric properties;inverse technique;optimization routines;resonant methods;resonant methods.","Cavity resonators;Dielectric loss measurement;Dielectrics;Optimization;Permittivity;Permittivity measurement;Shape","air gaps;dielectric materials;geometry;numerical analysis;optimisation;permittivity measurement","3D geometry;CST Microwave Studio;Computer Simulation Technology Microwave Studio;E-plane;MATLAB-based optimization routine;TE<sub>107</sub> mode;air gap;cavity perturbation technique;cavity slot;complex permittivity measurement;component object model interface;dielectric material sample;dielectric testing;generalized rectangular cavity-based unified approach;numerical field simulator;numerical optimization scheme;simulated scattering coefficient","","15","","28","","20140414","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We believe this is the first example of what might be described “big data” analysis in facial expression research. Automated facial coding was used to quantify eyebrow raise (AU2), eyebrow lowerer (AU4) and smile behaviors in the 700,000,000+ frames. Facial “events” were extracted and defined by a set of temporal features and then clustered using the k-means clustering algorithm. Verifying the observations in each cluster against human-coded data we were able to identify reliable clusters of facial events with different dynamics (e.g. fleeting vs. sustained and rapid offset vs. slow offset smiles). These events provide a way of summarizing behaviors that occur without prescribing the properties. We examined the how these nuanced facial events were tied to consumer behavior. We found that smile events - particularly those with high peaks - were much more likely to occur during viral ads. This data is cross-cultural, we also examine the prevalence of different events across regions of the globe.","","","10.1109/FG.2015.7163079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163079","","Encoding;Eyebrows;Face;Feature extraction;Media;Training;Webcams","Big Data;behavioural sciences computing;face recognition;feature extraction;image sequences;pattern clustering;video signal processing","Big Data analysis;automated facial coding;event detection;facial behavior;facial events extraction;facial expressions;human-coded data;k-means clustering algorithm;rich nonverbal information;ultra large-scale clustering;video sequences","","0","","22","","","4-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating these two environments by creating a novel prototype and conducting a preliminary pilot evaluation session. For the prototype system, a Facebook Group was utilised as a repository for learning content and the Open Wonderland platform was selected as a mixed reality intelligent environment for 3D virtual collaborative activities. Since tacit knowledge can be gained via collaborative group-based activities and discussions, a new Wonderland module was developed to integrate this platform with the Facebook group. Similarly, explicit knowledge can be learned directly via the prepared materials which are provided within the group repository. We hope to demonstrate that this approach can provide greater accessibility to the learning content since it can be accessed from both the 3D world and the 2D Facebook Group. In other words, this system can support both synchronous interaction as well as asynchronous data retrieval. Finally, the prototype system was evaluated by means of a two-hour task-based assessment and user-satisfaction questionnaire.

In the application of Fabry-Perot interferometry, the sensing element utilizes an optical cavity, where interference of multiple reflections changes with movement of the diaphragm caused by pressure. In the application of the piezoresistive effect, a change in the electrical resistivity of a sensor material is induced by mechanical stress in the diaphragm and detected by a Wheatstone bridge circuit.

While relentless spammers exploit the established trust relationships between account owners and their friends to efficiently spread malicious spam, timely detection of compromised accounts is quite challenging due to the well established trust relationship between the service providers, account owners, and their friends. In this paper, we study the social behaviors of OSN users, i.e., their usage of OSN services, and the application of which in detecting the compromised accounts. In particular, we propose a set of social behavioral features that can effectively characterize the user social activities on OSNs. We validate the efficacy of these behavioral features by collecting and analyzing real user clickstreams to an OSN website. Based on our measurement study, we devise individual user's social behavioral profile by combining its respective behavioral feature metrics. A social behavioral profile accurately reflects a user's OSN activity patterns. While an authentic owner conforms to its account's social behavioral profile involuntarily, it is hard and costly for impostors to feign. We evaluate the capability of the social behavioral profiles in distinguishing different OSN users, and our experimental results show the social behavioral profiles can accurately differentiate individual OSN users and detect compromised accounts.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2482465","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7277068","Online social behavior;compromised accounts detection;data analysis;privacy","Accuracy;Browsers;Facebook;Feature extraction;Measurement;Navigation;Uniform resource locators","behavioural sciences computing;data privacy;social networking (online);trusted computing","OSN user social behavioral profiles;compromised account detection;malicious spam;online social behaviors;online social networks;trust relationships","","","","28","","20150925","Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Sprangle","University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","","2016","52","6","1","6","This paper analyzes a mechanism for the remote optical measurements of magnetic field variations above the surface of seawater. This magnetometry mechanism is based on the polarization rotation of reflected polarized laser light, in the presence of the earth's magnetic field. Here the laser light is reflected off the surface of the water and off an underwater object. Two mechanisms responsible for the polarization rotation are the surface magneto-optical kerr effect (SMOKE) and the Faraday effect. In both the mechanisms, the degree of polarization rotation is proportional to the earth's local magnetic field. Variations in the earth's magnetic field due to an underwater object will result in variations in the polarization rotation of the laser light reflected off the water's surface (SMOKE) and off the underwater object (Faraday effect). An analytical expression is obtained for the polarization-rotated field when the incident plane wave is at arbitrary angle and polarization with respect to the water's surface. We find that the polarization rotated field due to SMOKE is small compared with that due to the Faraday effect.","0018-9197;00189197","","10.1109/JQE.2016.2557068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457214","Faraday effect;Magnetooptic effects;magnetometers;remote sensing","Faraday effect;Magnetic fields;Magnetometers;Nonlinear optics;Optical polarization;Optical surface waves;Sea surface","Faraday effect;Kerr magneto-optical effect;geomagnetism;magnetometry;remote sensing by laser beam;seawater;underwater optics","Earth local magnetic field;Faraday effect;SMOKE;arbitrary angle;incident plane wave;magnetic field variations;optical magnetometry mechanism;polarization rotated field;polarization rotation;polarization-rotated field;reflected polarized laser light;remote optical measurement;seawater surface;surface magneto-optical Kerr effect;underwater object","","","","9","","20160420","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although traditional processors implement caches as SRAMs, technologies such as STT-RAM (MRAM), and eDRAM have been used and/or considered for the implementation of L<sup>3</sup>Cs. Each of these technologies has inherent weaknesses: SRAM is relatively low density and has high leakage current; STT-RAM has high write latency and write energy consumption; and eDRAM requires refresh operations. As future processors are expected to have larger last-level caches, the goal of this paper is to study the trade-offs associated with using each of these technologies to implement L<sup>3</sup>Cs. In order to make useful comparisons between SRAM, STTRAM, and eDRAM L<sup>3</sup>Cs, we model them in detail and apply low power techniques to each of these technologies to address their respective weaknesses. We optimize SRAM for low leakage and optimize STT-RAM for low write energy. Moreover, we classify eDRAM refresh-reduction schemes into two categories and demonstrate the effectiveness of using dead-line prediction to eliminate unnecessary refreshes. A comparison of these technologies through full-system simulation shows that the proposed refresh-reduction method makes eDRAM a viable, energy-efficient technology for implementing L<sup>3</sup>Cs.","1530-0897;15300897","","10.1109/HPCA.2013.6522314","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522314","","CMOS integrated circuits;CMOS technology;Capacitors;Magnetic tunneling;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Transistors","DRAM chips;MRAM devices;SRAM chips;cache storage;energy consumption;low-power electronics;power aware computing","L<sup>3</sup>C;MRAM;dead-line prediction;eDRAM refresh-reduction schemes;energy-efficient technology;full-system simulation;large last-level caches;leakage current;low power techniques;low write-energy STT-RAM;low-leakage SRAM;refresh operations;refresh-optimized eDRAM;refresh-reduction method;technology comparison;write energy consumption;write latency","","14","","44","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we explore prediction models for whether a source file will be affected by a certain type of SCC.

For this matter, both industry and academia are proactively seeking opportunities on cross-layer power management schemes that could open a door for sustainable high-performance computing platform. In this paper we investigate an emerging trend in the IT industry: using promising onsite distributed generation (DG) techniques to provide premium clean energy to the computing load. We develop data center power demand shaping (PDS), a novel technique that allows data centers to utilize onsite green energy efficiently. In contrast to prior design, PDS takes advantage of a so-far unexplored power supply feature, i.e., the load following capabilities of DG systems to avoid the high performance penalty issue incurred during supply tracking. In addition, PDS features two adaptive power management schemes: DGR Boost and UPS Boost. These two workload-aware optimization methods leverage mature computer tuning knobs to achieve attractive data center performance improvement. Using real-world data center traces and industry data of distributed generation systems, we show that our technique can come within 1.2% performance of an ideal oracle, which is roughly a 37% improvement over existing supply tracking based design.

The new sensor operates at a wavelength of 532 nm and is fully interchangeable with an existing 1064 nm terrain mapping sensor operated by NCALM, connecting to the same electronics rack and fitting into the same aircraft mounting assembly. The sensor operates at laser pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) of 33, 50 and 70 kHz, making it possible to seamlessly map shallow water lakes, streams, and coastal waters along with the contiguous terrain, including rural and urban areas.

Detection of faults and reconfiguration of any audio device(s) that fail(s) is a time-consuming operation. This disruption in the audio system can affect the entire audio chain and affect the usability of the venue in question.

Previously, several attempts have been made to estimate the attenuation coefficients from emission data only. These attempts had limited success, because the problem does not have a unique solution, and severe and persistent “cross-talk” between the estimated activity and attenuation distributions was observed. In this paper, we show that the availability of time-of-flight (TOF) information eliminates the cross-talk problem by destroying symmetries in the associated Fisher information matrix. We propose a maximum-a-posteriori reconstruction algorithm for jointly estimating the attenuation and activity distributions from TOF PET data. The performance of the algorithm is studied with 2-D simulations, and further illustrated with phantom experiments and with a patient scan. The estimated attenuation image is robust to noise, and does not suffer from the cross-talk that was observed in non-TOF PET. However, some constraining is still mandatory, because the TOF data determine the attenuation sinogram only up to a constant offset.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2012.2212719","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6264102","Activity and attenuation cross-talk;attenuation correction;joint estimation;maximum likelihood;time-of-flight (TOF) positron emission tomography (PET)","Attenuation;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Joints;Maximum likelihood estimation;Phantoms;Positron emission tomography","image denoising;image reconstruction;medical image processing;phantoms;positron emission tomography;radioactive tracers;single photon emission computed tomography","2D simulation;Fisher information matrix;TOF PET data;activity distributions;attenuation coefficients;attenuation correction;attenuation distributions;attenuation sinogram;constant offset;cross-talk problem;emission data;estimated activity;estimated attenuation imaging;maximum-a-posteriori reconstruction algorithm;patient scan;performance algorithm;persistent cross-talk;phantom;positron emission tomography;quantitative reconstruction;robust noise;simultaneous reconstruction;single photon emission tomography;time-of-fight information;time-of-flight PET;tracer distribution","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Phantoms, Imaging;Positron-Emission Tomography;Thorax","55","1","34","","20120809","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A theoretical model is presented that integrates the effect of the high electric field inversion region upon energy distribution function of the impinging carriers with the transmission probability of those carriers across the heterointerface. The transport of the photocarriers across the high electric field inversion region is simulated by the full solution of the Boltzmann transport equation by Monte Carlo technique while the transmission probability of carriers across the heterointerface is calculated through the percolation path technique. The results are discussed under two different condition of band bending; strongly inverted and weakly inverted c-Si surface. The results comparing different conditions of band bending show that the energy distribution of the carriers impinging on the heterointerface is non-Maxwellian and the integrated photocarrier collection increases with the strength of the inversion field since the carrier population is weighted towards higher energy where the transmission probability through the barrier is higher.

Additionally, among the visual stimuli, the reaction time of the arrow was the smallest standard deviation (SD), and activated cerebellum as well as supplementary motor area.

In this paper, we propose a new method to reduce compression artifacts by the overlapped-block transform coefficient estimation from non-local blocks. In the proposed method, the discrete cosine transform coefficients of each block are estimated by adaptively fusing two prediction values based on their reliabilities. One prediction is the quantized values of coefficients decoded from the compressed bitstream, whose reliability is determined by quantization steps. The other prediction is the weighted average of the coefficients in nonlocal blocks, whose reliability depends on the variance of the coefficients in these blocks. The weights are used to distinguish the effectiveness of the coefficients in nonlocal blocks to predict original coefficients and are determined by block similarity in transform domain. To solve the optimization problem, the overlapped blocks are divided into several subsets. Each subset contains nonoverlapped blocks covering the whole image and is optimized independently. Therefore, the overall optimization is reduced to a set of sub-optimization problems, which can be easily solved. Finally, we provide a strategy for parameter selection based on the compression levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method can remarkably reduce compression artifacts and significantly improve both the subjective and objective qualities of block transform coded images.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2013.2274386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566149","Block transform coding;block similarity;compression artifacts;denoising;post-processing","Discrete cosine transforms;Image coding;Noise;Predictive models;Quantization (signal);Transform coding","block codes;image coding;transform coding","block similarity;block transform coded images;coarse quantization;compression artifact reduction;compression levels;low bit rates;objective qualities;overlapped-block transform coefficient estimation;parameter selection;subjective qualities;transform coefficients","","27","","38","","20130723","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Essence is a software engineering kernel and language developed by SEMAT, whose aim is to find a common ground of software engineering. We chose Essence as a foundation because of its unique features such as being comprehensive, model-based, and extensible. We demonstrate the use of this framework by taking an existing case study research and analyzing how Essence could report its findings more systematically and comprehensively. The case study we investigate is about whether the customer representative role is too demanding in an extreme programming (XP) environment. Using the Essence framework, we found a strong validity threat to this case study. Although the validity threat could also be detected otherwise, the fact that it was not detected previously only highlight the importance of having greater rigor in case study reporting and evaluation, which is why a framework is necessary.

"Interference-Aware Wireless Network-on-Chip Architecture using Directional Antennas","H. Mondal; S. Gade; M. Shamim; S. Deb; A. Ganguly","","IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Wireless Network-on-Chip (WiNoC) has been recently introduced for addressing the scalability limitations of conventional multi-hop NoC architectures. Existing WiNoC architectures generally use millimeter-wave antennas without significant directional gains, along with token passing protocol to access the shared wireless medium. This limits the achievable performance benefits since only one wireless pair can communicate at a time. It is also not practical in the immediate future to arbitrarily scale up the number of non-overlapping channels by designing transceivers operating in disjoint frequency bands in the millimeter-wave spectrum commonly adopted for on-chip wireless interconnects. Consequently, we explore the use of directional antennas whereby multiple wireless interconnect pairs can communicate simultaneously. However, concurrent wireless communications can result in interference. This can be minimized in NoC by optimal placement of wireless interfaces (WIs) to maximize performance while minimizing interference. To address this, we propose an interference-aware WIs placement algorithm with routing strategy for WiNoC architecture by incorporating directional planar log-periodic antennas (PLPAs). This directional wireless network-on-chip (DWiNoC) architecture enables point-to-point links between transceivers and hence multiple wireless links can operate at the same time without interference","","","10.1109/TMSCS.2016.2595527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524738","Directional antenna;interference-aware placement;on-chip interconnection networks;wireless network-on-chip","Antennas;Computer architecture;Interference;Network topology;System-on-chip;Transceivers;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","20160728","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper explores the economic feasibility of residential EVs acting as flexible demands by responding to the price signals within a smart grid framework where EVs discharge at price peaks and recharge when the price is low. The demand side response (DSR) is designed to obtain the objective of energy cost minimization by reacting to price signals in a suitable manner. EV availability is explicitly taken into account in terms of the location of the vehicle and the battery state of charge (SoC), and the cost of battery degradation is also considered in the optimal scheduling of EV charging and discharging. Network constraints in terms of the voltage level of the customer connection points are applied to insure that operation of the grid remains within the statutory limits. This proposed EV scheduling optimization approach is implemented using a case study of a typical domestic distribution network in the UK, in which the real time price (RTP) signal is applied and the UK Time Use Survey (TUS) data is used to provide the vehicle driving patterns and the associated battery SoC information.","","","10.1049/cp.2015.0325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7446482","Electric vehicle (EV);Vehicle-to-grid (V2G);demand side response (DSR);energy cost minimization","","battery powered vehicles;demand side management;optimisation;power generation scheduling;secondary cells","EV charging;UK time use survey;battery state of charge;electric vehicles;global energy system;optimal demand side response;optimal scheduling;real time price signal","","","","","","","17-18 Oct. 2015","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

We measured the weld force after every contact making in a low-voltage condition (200 V-AC). The arc current was set to 140 to 500 A by using a reactor load, the arc duration time was within 0.22 to 2.37 ms, and the contact material was pure silver (99.99 %). In this condition, we clarified that the weld force increases depending on arc energy supplied to the contact surface. We also measured the melted area on contact surface and clarified the area dependence on the arc energy. Considering that the tensile strength of silver is 170 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, the measured melted area is too large as a welded area. Then we found out that the real welded area corresponds to about 25 % of the melted area. As a conclusion, we suggest that a vaporized area on the contact surface may not be involved in contact welding, from the analytical simulation of thermal conduction in the contact model. The real welded area is the region whose temperature is higher than the melting temperature and that remains without evaporation.","","","10.1109/HOLM.2015.7355090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7355090","arc;bounce;contact;low voltage switch;welding","Cathodes;Contacts;Current measurement;Force;Heating;Voltage measurement;Welding","arcs (electric);electrical contacts;silver;switches","arc current;arc duration time;arc energy;bounce arc;contact material;contact surface;contact weld force;contact welding mechanism;low voltage switches;low-voltage condition;reactor load;silver;tensile strength;thermal conduction","","","","15","","","11-14 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Available objective methods for monitoring real-world arm use rely on placing movement sensors on patients. These methods provide information on amount but not type of arm activity, e.g., functional versus nonfunctional movement. This paper presents an approach that places sensors on patients and household objects, overcoming this limitation. An accelerometer and the transmitter component of a radio-frequency proximity sensor are attached to objects; the receiver component is attached to the arm of interest. The receiver triggers an on-board radio-frequency identification tag to signal proximity when that arm is within 23 cm of an instrumented object. In benchmark testing, this system detected perfectly which arm was used to move the target object on 200 trials. In a laboratory study with 35 undergraduates, increasing the amount of time target objects were moved with the arm of interest resulted in a corresponding increase in system output (<i>p</i> <; 0.0001) . Moreover, measurement error was low (≤2.5%). The results support this system's reliability and validity in individuals with unimpaired movement; testing is now warranted in stroke patients.","1534-4320;15344320","","10.1109/TNSRE.2012.2210561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6259885","Accelerometer;ambulatory monitoring in stroke survivors;proximity sensor;radio-frequency identification (RFID)","Accelerometers;Arm;Patient monitoring;Radiofrequency identification;Receivers;Sensitivity","accelerometers;benchmark testing;biomechanics;biomedical equipment;biomedical telemetry;measurement errors;patient monitoring;patient treatment;radiofrequency identification;reliability;transmitters","accelerometer;arm activity monitoring;benchmark testing;functional movement;measurement error;movement sensors;nonfunctional movement;on-board radiofrequency identification tag;radiofrequency proximity sensor;receiver component;reliability;sensor-enabled RFID system;signal proximity;stroke;transmitter component;treatment setting;unimpaired movement","Acceleration;Activities of Daily Living;Adolescent;Adult;Arm;Benchmarking;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Female;Hand;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Movement;Psychomotor Performance;Radio;Radio Waves;Reproducibility of Results;Young Adult","4","","18","","20120803","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our hardware accelerator employs a novel hashing based approach instead of commonly used deterministic finite automata (DFA) based algorithms. A limitation of the DFA based approaches is that they typically process one character every cycle, while the proposed hash based scheme can process a string token every cycle, thus achieving significantly higher processing throughput than the DFA based implementations. Our measurement results based on a prototype implementation on an Altera Stratix IV FPGA device indicate that our hardware dictionary matching engine can process typical document streams at a processing rate of ~1.5GB/s (~12 Gbps) while simultaneously allowing support for large dictionary sizes containing up to ~100K patterns, thus making it very useful for IE workload acceleration.","1063-6862;10636862","","10.1109/ASAP.2013.6567551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567551","FPGA;dictionary matching;hardware acceleration;hashing;information extraction;pattern matching;string matching;text analytics","Arrays;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Throughput","dictionaries;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;information retrieval systems;string matching;text analysis","Altera Stratix IV FPGA device;DFA based algorithms;IE systems;IE workload acceleration;deterministic finite automata based algorithms;hardware accelerator;hardware dictionary matching engine;hashing based approach;high throughput dictionary matching;high-speed dictionary matching engine;information extraction system;large-scale dictionary matching engine;scalable hardware architecture;string matching;string token;text analytics applications","","1","","19","","","5-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The participants' impressions of the dialogue interactions and of the robot were obtained under four conditions (w/ light blinking or w/o blinking; humanoid or cuboid robot). The cuboid robot created a stronger impression of comfort and excitement for the interactions while the blinking light did not create a strong impression of anything.

Based on our analysis of the case study, we propose the solutions for enhancing video streaming experience in wireless mesh networks from a cross-layer perspective which leverage the information across network (routing) layer and link (MAC) layer. The MAC layer retransmission count is exploited to guide the interface queue management for video packets. In addition, this retransmission count is also used as a metric to construct a retransmission-aware QoS routing scheme for video streams. In our approach, the upper layers are aware of the dynamic network status via retransmission count, so timely QoS decision can be made to enhance video quality effectively.

Since when the potential relay say x is closer to the destination, the channel quality between them is better, moreover fewer collisions would occur as there are less number of potential relays closer to the destination than x and selecting the node with sufficient residual energy as relay would withstand throughout the duration of retransmission.","","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6949938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949938","Cooperative communication;RSSI;distance;relay;relay selection;residual energy","Ad hoc networks;Cooperative communication;Energy measurement;Indexes;Mobile computing;Performance evaluation;Relays","cooperative communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication channels","RED factors;RSSI;channel quality;communication devices;cooperative communications;mobile ad-hoc networks;optimal relay;relay node;relay selection mechanism;relay transmission;retransmission duration","","0","","16","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reduce the interpretation overhead of DVM, Google has included a trace-based just-in-time compiler (JITC) in the latest version of Android. Due to limited resources and the requirement for reasonable response time, the JITC is unable to apply deep optimizations to generate high quality code. In this paper, we propose a method-based ahead-of-time compiler (AOTC), called Icing, to speed up the execution of Android applications without the modification of any components of Android framework. The main idea of Icing is to convert the hot methods of an application program from DEX code to C code and uses the GCC compiler to translate the C code to the corresponding native code. With the Java Native Interface (JNI) library, the translated native code can be called by DVM. Both AOTC and JITC have their strength and weakness. In order to combine the strength and avoid the weakness of AOTC and JITC, in Icing, we have proposed a cost model to determine whether a method should be handled by AOTC or JITC during profiling. To evaluate the performance of Icing, four benchmarks used by Google JITC are used as test cases. The performance results show that, with Icing, the execution time of an application is two to three times faster than that without JITC, and 25% to 110% faster than that with JITC.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062027","Ahead-of-time compiler;Android;Dalvik bytecode;just-in-time compiler;reverse engineering;static profiling","Androids;Google;Humanoid robots;Java;Libraries;Optimization;Registers","Java;mobile computing;program compilers;virtual machines","AOTC;Android applications;C code;DEX code;Dalvik virtual machine;GCC compiler;Google JITC;Icing;Java native interface library;cost model;method-based ahead-of-time compiler;trace-based just-in-time compiler","","0","1","28","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"CCGA solder column ??? Reliable solution for absorbing large CTE mismatch","M. Hart","TOPLINE CORPORATION, Irvine California, USA","2015 European Microelectronics Packaging Conference (EMPC)","","2015","","","1","5","Solder balls encounter large stresses due to the inherent mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between a large ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) and a glass-epoxy printed circuit board (PCB). The array of solder balls are stretched and squeezed with considerable strain from corner to corner across a large square CBGA module, as the temperature swings plus and minus 100o C from hot to cold in repeated cycles, typically encountered in harsh operating environments of aerospace and defence. While the amount of travel - about the thickness of a single sheet of paper - seems small, such movement ultimately leads to catastrophic failure as solder balls delaminate from the PCB board and/or the ceramic CBGA module. Overcoming CTE mismatch can be accomplished by replacing spherically shaped solder balls with cylindrically shaped solder columns, making a device known as a Ceramic Column Grid array (CCGA). CCGA Solder columns are compliant and offer improved absorption from CTE stresses caused by stretching and pulling in applications involving high vibration, shock and wide temperature variations. This presentation covers several types of solder columns that are commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) available such as plain Pb90/Sn10 columns, copper wrapped Pb80/Sn20 columns and Micro-coil Springs. This paper provides ""safe-harbour"" recommendations when it is safe to use CBGA with solder balls, and when it is best to use CCGA with solder columns.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7390733","CCGA;Micro-Coil Spring;Pin-Pack;column grid array;solder columns","Arrays;Ceramics;Copper;Springs;Strain;Stress;Substrates","ball grid arrays;ceramic packaging;copper alloys;failure analysis;lead alloys;printed circuits;solders;thermal expansion;thermal stresses;tin alloys","CCGA solder column-reliable solution;CCGA solder columns;COTS;Cu-Pb-Sn;PCB;catastrophic failure;ceramic CBGA module;ceramic column grid array;coefficient of thermal expansion;commercially-off-the-shelf;cylindrically shaped solder columns;glass-epoxy printed circuit board;large CTE mismatch absorption;large ceramic ball grid array;large square CBGA module;microcoil springs;solder ball array;spherically shaped solder balls","","","","5","","","14-16 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there remain major challenges to realise this scenario such as decisions on the optimal node location, node orientation, transmit power level, and the number of nodes to cover the area of interest (sensed environment) which if not correct can lead to poor coverage or over-provisioned, oversized networks. In this paper we experiment with a BAN device and nodes deployed in a variety of locations throughout an office environment to represent a sensed environment. Packet loss rates (PLR) were analysed to explore trade-offs between node densities and transmit power levels. We determine that the deployment location, the density, and BAN transmission power level are important factors to be considered in the scenario where a mobile BAN communicates with a sensed environment. We found that deploying the environment nodes at chest height on the surrounding wall yielded the best results in terms of coverage and node density providing an optimal link between the BAN and the sensed environment.","","","10.1049/ic.2013.0049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6621235","Body Area Networks (BAN);Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN);sensed environment;sensors;wireless","","body area networks;body sensor networks;mobile radio;radio links;radio transmitters","PLR;deployment location determination;health monitoring;low power wireless body area network;mobile BAN communication;node density;node orientation;on-body communication device;optimal node location;overprovisioned network;oversized network;packet loss rate;power level transmission;wireless sensor network","","0","","","","","20-21 June 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

However, their compression efficiency is still insufficient for certain domains where a plethora of video data should be archived. One example is the domain of medical endoscopy where entire surgeries are recorded for documentation with high visual quality because it is not possible to anticipate if and when exceptional situations may happen. Eventually, only a fraction of the video footage is of actual relevance for post-operative review. In this paper, we introduce the concept of domain-specific video compression by the example of this very specific domain. We identify several characteristics of endoscopic surgery videos that can be exploited by content-based analysis algorithms to achieve a significantly higher compression efficiency than in current practice. The extensive evaluation shows that the proposed methods massively reduce the data volume without any semantic information loss and thus allow for long-term video archiving of endoscopic surgery videos. Moreover, we expect to stimulate future research in this challenging new field.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9036-1; POD:978-1-4673-9037-8","10.1109/CBMS.2016.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7546009","Domain-specific video compression;content-based video analysis;endoscopic video","Biomedical imaging;Documentation;Endoscopes;Semantics;Surgery;Video compression;Visualization","data compression;endoscopes;information retrieval systems;medical image processing;surgery;video coding","compression efficiency;content-based analysis algorithms;domain-specific video compression;endoscopic surgery videos;long-term video archiving;lossy video compression;medical endoscopy","","","","","","","20-24 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These superior characteristics make GaN HEMTs ideal for high-frequency, high-efficiency power conversion. Using efficient GaN HEMT devices switched at high frequency in power electronic systems could lead to an increase in power density as well as a reduction in the weight, size, and cost of the system. However, conventional packaging configurations often compromise the benefits provided by high-performance GaN HEMT devices, for example, by increasing the parasitic inductance and resistance in the current loops of the device. This undesirable package-induced performance degradation is prominent in the cascode GaN device, where the combination of a high-voltage depletion-mode GaN semiconductor and low-voltage enhancement-mode Si semiconductor is needed. In this study, a new package is introduced for high-voltage cascode GaN devices and is successfully demonstrated to make the device more suitable for megahertz operation. This packaging prototype for cascode GaN devices is fabricated in a power quad flat no-lead format with the new features of a stack-die structure, embedded external capacitor, and flip-chip configuration. The parasitic ringing in hard-switching turn-off and switching losses in soft-switching transitions are both effectively reduced for this newly packaged device compared with a traditional package using the same GaN and Si devices. Improved thermal dissipation capability is also realized using this new package for better reliability.","0885-8993;08858993","","10.1109/TPEL.2015.2418572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073649","Cascode structure;gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT);high frequency;packaging;stack-die structure","Electronic packaging thermal management;Gallium nitride;HEMTs;MOSFET;Performance evaluation;Silicon;Switches","III-V semiconductors;current density;electrical conductivity transitions;flip-chip devices;gallium compounds;power HEMT;power electronics;semiconductor device packaging;semiconductor device reliability;silicon;wide band gap semiconductors","GaN;HEMT power devices;Si;current density;current loops;embedded external capacitor;flip-chip configuration;hard-switching turn-off;high-electron-mobility transistor;high-voltage cascode devices;high-voltage cascode gallium nitride device;high-voltage depletion-mode semiconductor;low-voltage enhancement-mode semiconductor;packaged device;packaging configurations;parasitic inductance;parasitic ringing;power conversion;power density;power electronic systems;power quad flat no-lead format;semiconductor devices;silicon;soft-switching transitions;stack-die structure;switching losses;switching speed;thermal dissipation capability","","4","","31","","20150331","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Qiu","University of Adelaide, Australia","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","","2012","20","3","662","676","Despite advances in measurement technology, it is still challenging to reliably compile large-scale network datasets. For example, because of flaws in the measurement systems or difficulties posed by the measurement problem itself, missing, ambiguous, or indirect data are common. In the case where such data have spatio-temporal structure, it is natural to try to leverage this structure to deal with the challenges posed by the problematic nature of the data. Our work involving network datasets draws on ideas from the area of compressive sensing and matrix completion, where sparsity is exploited in estimating quantities of interest. However, the standard results on compressive sensing are: 1) reliant on conditions that generally do not hold for network datasets; and 2) do not allow us to exploit all we know about their spatio-temporal structure. In this paper, we overcome these limitations with an algorithm that has at its heart the same ideas espoused in compressive sensing, but adapted to the problem of network datasets. We show how this algorithm can be used in a variety of ways, in particular on traffic data, to solve problems such as simple interpolation of missing values, traffic matrix inference from link data, prediction, and anomaly detection. The elegance of the approach lies in the fact that it unifies all of these tasks and allows them to be performed even when as much as 98% of the data is missing.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2169424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058636","Compressed sensing;interpolation;prediction methods;tomography","Approximation algorithms;Compressed sensing;Interpolation;Matrix decomposition;Redundancy;Sparse matrices","Internet;compressed sensing;matrix algebra;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic matrices;large-scale network datasets;measurement systems;measurement technology;spatio-temporal compressive sensing;spatio-temporal structure;traffic data","","27","","44","","20111021","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Revenue management provides a particular challenge as its success depends not only on the customer choice, competition and sophisticated operations research algorithms, but also on analysts' understanding.

In order to analyze the EEG signals for spectral estimation, it was used the Periodogram method computed in three different frequencies in μ-rythm (8 a 13Hz) and β-rythm (14 a 25Hz) frequencies to generate the Naive Bayes classifier entries.

It is a well-known fact that the best way to increase capacity in a unit area is to introduce smaller cells. Local area communications are currently mainly driven by the IEEE 802.11 WLAN family being cheap and energy efficient with a low number of users per access point. For the future high user density scenarios, following the 802.11 HEW study group, the 802.11ax project has been initiated to improve the WLAN system performance. The 3GPP LTE-advanced (LTE-A) also includes new methods for pico and femto cell's interference management functionalities for small cell communications. The main problem with LTE-A is, however, that the physical layer numerology is still optimized for macrocells and not for local area communications. Furthermore, the overall complexity and the overheads of the control plane and reference symbols are too large for spectrally and energy efficient local area communications. In this paper, we provide first an overview of WLAN 802.11ac and LTE/LTE-A, discuss the pros and cons of both technology areas, and then derive a new flexible TDD-based radio interface parametrization for 5G local area communications combining the best practices of both WiFi and LTE-A technologies. We justify the system design based on local area propagation characteristics and expected traffic distributions and derive targets for future local area concepts. We concentrate on initial physical layer design and discuss how it maps to higher layer improvements. This paper shows that the new design can significantly reduce the latency of the system, and offer increased sleeping opportunities on both base station and user equipment sides leading to enhanced power savings. In addition, through careful design of the control overhead, we are able to improve the channel utilization when compared- with LTE-A.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2355415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6891105","5G;802.11ac;802.11ax;HEW SG;LTE/LTE-advanced;WLAN;energy efficiency;flexible TDD;green radio;local area;low latency;small cell networks","Long Term Evolution;Mobile communication;OFDM;Physical layer;Throughput;Uplink;Wireless LAN","4G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;femtocellular radio;picocellular radio;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;time division multiplexing;wireless LAN","3GPP Long Term Evolution-Advanced;5G local area communications;IEEE 802.11ac;IEEE 802.11ax project;LTE-A;TDD-based radio interface parametrization;WLAN family;Wi-Fi;access point;base station;channel utilization;control overhead;control plane;interference management;mobile data;radio interface evolution;reference symbols;time division duplex;traffic distributions;wireless local area network","","15","","69","","20140904","2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The model developed is 3-D, is time dependent, and assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The study has been carried out considering an axial injection of air with flow rates varying in the range of 0.16-0.5 g/s and currents varying in the range of 300-600 mA. The numerical modeling has been developed using Code_Saturne, a computational fluid dynamics software developed by EDF R&D which is based on colocated finite volume. After a detailed description of the model, the results are presented, analyzed, and discussed. The influence of current and that of air flow rate over the arc characteristics are studied in terms of temperature, velocity, electrical potential, Joule heating, and arc root motion. Regarding numerical issues, the MHD modeling of low-current high-voltage arc discharge is particularly tricky since, below 1 A, the self-induced magnetic field becomes negligible and the convection effects induce a highly irregular and unstable motion of the arc column. However, despite these difficulties, the numerical model has been successfully implemented. Numerical results have shown good correlation and good trends with experimental ones despite a discrepancy which is probably due to the LTE assumption. The model gave fruitful and significant information on parameters that could hardly be obtained experimentally. This preliminary work is likely to open the way toward a better understanding of low-current arc discharges, which technologies are currently encountering an important development in many application fields.","0093-3813;00933813","","10.1109/TPS.2011.2160208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6003794","3-D MHD unsteady modeling;Low-current dc arc discharge;nontransferred plasma torch","Atmospheric modeling;Cathodes;Equations;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Plasma temperature","air;arcs (electric);computational fluid dynamics;finite volume methods;plasma instability;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma ohmic heating;plasma temperature;plasma thermodynamics;plasma torches;plasma transport processes","Code_Saturne;Joule heating;air flow rate;arc column unstable motion;colocated finite volume method;computational fluid dynamics software;convection effect;current 300 mA to 600 mA;electrical potential;high-voltage low-current condition;local thermodynamic equilibrium;low-current high-voltage arc discharge characteristics;low-current high-voltage nontransferred DC plasma torch;numerical model;self-induced magnetic field;temperature analysis;three-dimensional unsteady MHD model;velocity analysis","","1","","45","","20110825","Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The display system uses a micromirror which consists of a simple two-thin-film structure and is fabricated using a surface-micromachining process, i.e., Polysilicon Multi User MEMS Processes. The micromirror exhibits rotational motion around two axes as well as translational motion through four repulsive-force electrostatic actuating units. The micromirror is free of the “pull-in” effect which is associated with conventional micro electrostatic actuators. The micromirror is operated in a nonresonant mode and is capable of static positioning. Measured data show that the micromirror can achieve an optical scanning angle of ±2.5° in each axis. The measured bandwidth (-3 dB) for each driving unit is 2000 Hz operating at a sinusoidal input voltage of 0-200 V. The settling times of the actuating unit are 2.75 and 3.32 ms with overshoots of 5% and 48% for step inputs of 200 to 0 V and 0 to 200 V, respectively. The portable vector display system is developed through integrating the micromirror, a laser source, the optics, and a microcontroller and is shown to be very effective in displaying complex geometries.

New services are now starting to run on these networks to meet the requests of modern users. To offer good service typically hard constraints have to be satisfied, especially when real-time services are involved. To this aim the reliable estimation of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters as bandwidth, packet jitter, latency, one way delay, to cite a few, is a key issue for communication networks setup, monitoring and tuning. Generally, the measurement of QoS parameters is a complex process that involves several troubles. Some of them depend on the measurement network features: (i) the medium employed to convey the data stream (optic fiber, wireless, wired, etc.), (ii) the type and number of network devices involved (network interface cards, switches, routers, etc.), (iii) the type of communication and access protocols, and (iv) the variability of the network background traffic which could strongly influence the measurement result. Further troubles come from the measurement chain and the measurement method adopted: type of measurement instruments, sampling and observation times, packet size, type of measurement post processing to cite a few. Therefore, they can be thought as sources of measurement uncertainty able to strongly influence the measurement process and the reliability of the results. With reference to the measurement chain and the measurement method adopted, in this paper a deep sensitivity analysis aimed to identify the main quantities influencing the measurement results and to study their modeling as uncertainty components is performed. The attention has been focused on the packet jitter estimation made on a real test bed: the fiber optic based local area network of the University of Cassino (Italy).","","","10.1109/IWMN.2011.6088488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088488","Communication networks test and measurement;measurement uncertainty;metrological characterization;packet jitter;quality of service (QoS)","Jitter;Measurement uncertainty;Optical switches;Quality of service;Size measurement;Time measurement;Uncertainty","access protocols;jitter;optical fibre LAN;quality of service;telecommunication networks","QoS parameter estimation;access protocol;bandwidth;communication network;data stream;deep sensitivity analysis;fiber optic based local area network;network background traffic;one way delay;packet jitter estimation;packet jitter measurement;quality of service;real-time service","","9","","22","","","10-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Coated with a non-conducting polyepichlorohydrin (PECH) film, the TFTs under constant voltage bias exhibit a reversible response to varying ethanol concentrations in the gas phase.

Mobile traffic offloading through Wi-Fi networks has emerged as an effective way of supplementing cellular services. This approach has been proven very effective to reduce the load of delay-tolerant traffic in cellular networks. Recent developments suggest that real-time traffic like VoIP could be also offloaded if Wi-Fi networks supported a reasonable number of concurrent calls. In this way, ubiquitous IEEE 802.11 networks operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band could complement the cellular systems in indoor and rural environments. Wi-Fi networks are allocated 14 channels in this frequency band, thereof only 3 non-overlapped channels are allowed for Wi-Fi extended service sets in order to avoid interference. In this paper we investigate the use of assignment configurations with 4 partially-overlapped channels for VoIP transmissions, which may increase the network capacity in terms of concurrent users supported by Wi-Fi networks. Through computer simulations we demonstrate that 4-channel configurations are feasible at the expense of a tolerable degradation in quality of service for voice traffic with pedestrian mobility.","1525-3511;15253511","","10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7127493","Cellular Systems;Traffic Offloading;VoIP;Wi-Fi","Bit error rate;Europe;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Interference;Layout;Mobile communication;Quality of service","Internet;Internet telephony;quality of service;telecommunication traffic;ubiquitous computing;wireless LAN;wireless channels","VoIP transmission;VoIP transmissions;Wi-Fi extended service sets;Wi-Fi networks;cellular networks;cellular services;cellular traffic;channel configurations;delay tolerant traffic;mobile traffic offloading;partially overlapped channels;pedestrian mobility;quality of service;real-time traffic like VoIP;ubiquitous mobile Internet access;voice traffic","","1","","19","","","9-12 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The outcome is a highly-virtual sing cloud resource broker. It consists of a fiduciary resource service marketplace and a consumer-configurable virtual machine for resource sharing. The system supports hierarchically nested virtualization with dynamically adjustable resource limits for fine-grained structural, temporal and vertical-spatial scalability.

Debates over the possibility and practicality of such systems have only intensified with the increased use of robotics in the military arena and the ubiquity of AI in commercial products. Modern innovations, such as the driverless car, will likely make artificial ethical agents a legal necessity. As a research field, it has received relatively little attention compared to other, more traditional, AI problems. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up reactive system that provides one possible solution. We will begin by describing the motivation to this work: the development of artificial ethical agents could both mitigate some fears about the future of autonomous AI, and providing insight into human moral reasoning. We then explore the related work, including the current attempts at simulating ethics. We describe our novel approach to ethical simulation, Vessels; a Braitenberg Vehicle inspired reactive agent approach. We, then, demonstrate how Vessels can be configured to simulate both Egoism and Altruism, comparing our simulations to the normative theory.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8460-5; POD:978-1-4673-8461-2","10.1109/SAI.2016.7556023","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556023","Braitenberg Vehicles;Simulated Ethics","Actuators;Artificial intelligence;Cognition;Ethics;Robots;Sensors;Vehicles","","","","","","","","","13-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, as technology shrinks, the power contribute of NoC links starts to compete with that of NoC routers. In this paper, we propose the use of data encoding techniques as a viable way to reduce both power dissipation and energy consumption of NoC links. The proposed encoding scheme exploits the wormhole switching techniques and works on an end-to-end basis. That is, flits are encoded by the network interface (NI) before they are injected in the network and are decoded by the destination NI. This makes the scheme transparent to the underlying network since the encoder and decoder logic is integrated in the NI and no modification of the routers architecture is required. We assess the proposed encoding scheme on a set of representative data streams (both synthetic and extracted from real applications) showing that it is possible to reduce the power contribution of both the self-switching activity and the coupling switching activity in inter-routers links. As results, we obtain a reduction in total power dissipation and energy consumption up to 37% and 18%, respectively, without any significant degradation in terms of both performance and silicon area.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2010.2098590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5752410","Coupling capacitance;data encoding;low power;network on chip (NoC);power analysis","Capacitance;Decoding;Encoding;Nickel;Power dissipation;Switches;System-on-a-chip","decoding;encoding;low-power electronics;network interfaces;network routing;network-on-chip","NoC router;SoC;coupling switching activity;data encoding;decoder logic;encoder logic;energy consumption;interconnection system;interrouter link;network interface;network-on-chip;power dissipation;router architecture;self-switching activity;system-on-chip;wormhole switching technique","","16","","43","","","May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The structure of a multilevel inverter is to synthesize sinusoidal waveform from several levels of voltages. This paper deals with a novel seven level cascaded multilevel inverter. Almost all the drawbacks of the conventional multilevel inverters is rectified by the proposed topology. This topology uses less number of switches as compared with conventional topology, where it reduces the complexity and overall size of the system which in turn reduces the harmonics and cost of the entire system. Fewer switches will be conducting for specific time intervals so switching loss is also reduced in the proposed topology. A seven level inverter simulation is carried with the implementation of nearest level control.

Previous work on flat routing is through modifying network layer protocol or extending Ethernet network, but both of the methods are difficult to scale up. In this paper, a flat routing method based on centralized network architecture called CFR (Centralized Flat Routing) is proposed and analyzed. By connecting multiple commodity Ethernet networks through a SDN/OpenFlow network, a popular centralized architecture, we show it to be a scalable method through proof-of-concept experiment covering various scalability issues.

Although impressive results have been achieved, to increase the robustness of this system, more features and objects will be analyzed and used in the future.","","","10.1109/IMCCC.2011.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6154074","SURF;keypoints;matching;video retrieval","Databases;Feature extraction;Glass;Image matching;Lighting;Mobile handsets;Senior citizens","computer vision;feature extraction;image matching;video retrieval","SURF;object image;object image matching;object-placing process;senior citizens;speeded up robust feature point extraction;video clips;video database;vision-based system","","1","","13","","","21-23 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While Radio Resource Management (RRM) is known to mitigate this effects its application in residential WiFi networks being by nature unplanned and individually managed creates a big challenge. We propose ResFi - a framework supporting creation of RRM functionality in legacy deployments. The radio interfaces are used for efficient discovery of adjacent APs and as a side-channel to establish a secure communication among the individual Access Point Management Applications within a neighborhood over the wired Internet backbone. We have implemented a prototype of ResFi and studied its performance in our testbed. As a showcase we have implemented various RRM applications among others a distributed channel assignment algorithm using ResFi.

Using online ethnography, this study attempts to explicate how the designers have delegated facilitation to these objects. The findings suggest that the artifacts play a distinct role in enacting forms of facilitation and sustaining the course without teaching presence. They indicate that the artifacts do not play simply an intermediary role, but work to redistribute facilitation and reformulate social relations. While online courses have relied primarily upon teachers, with the increased size and technological interdependence of this MOOC, the examined artifacts apparently remove the need for exposure to teachers, by providing participants with peer interactions and automated coordination and testing.","1530-1605;15301605","","10.1109/HICSS.2014.208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758805","MOOC;design;facilitation;inscription;sociomateriality","Blogs;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Interviews;Materials;Software","computer aided instruction;educational courses;public domain software","actor network theory;automated coordination;automated testing;facilitation redistribution;massive open online course;online ethnography;social relations reformulation;unmanned MOOC","","1","","22","","","6-9 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we propose an approach to improve the user experience by giving more bandwidth to preferred applications. We describe a preliminary model explaining our technique in detail. Further, we validate our proposal using real time test setup with Wireshark traffic analyzer, and results are detailed with respect to (1) Percentage of network share (2) Jitter experience and (3) Time taken for the algorithm to adapt. Proposed algorithm has been tested in two different platforms such as Android and Tizen. Our preliminary observations show that our proposed algorithm allocates more bandwidth to high priority applications while maintaining the low priority APPs are intact with above minimum bandwidth.

We give a performance comparison of the generalized IPA with the reconstruction algorithms based on 1) linear programming and 2) verification decoding. Then we identify signals not recoverable by the IPA on a given measurement matrix, and show that these signals are related to stopping sets responsible to failures of iterative decoding algorithms on the binary erasure channel (BEC). Contrary to the results of the iterative decoding on the BEC, the smallest stopping set of a measurement matrix is not the smallest configuration on which the IPA fails. We analyze the recovery of sparse signals on subsets of stopping sets via the IPA and provide sufficient conditions on the exact recovery of sparse signals.

"Correcting perceived perspective distortions using object specific planar transformations","M. A. Tehrani; A. Majumder; M. Gopi","University of California Irvine","2016 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","","2016","","","1","10","Distortions due to perspective projection is often described under the umbrella term of foreshortening in computer graphics and are treated the same way. However, a large body of literature from artists, perceptual psychologists and perception scientists have shown that the perception of these distortions is different in different situations. While the distortions themselves depend on both the depth and the orientation of the object with respect to the camera image plane, the perception of these distortions depends on other depth cues present in the image. In the absence of any depth cue or prior knowledge about the objects in the scene, the visual system finds it hard to correct the foreshortening automatically and such images need user input and external algorithmic distortion correction.In this paper, we claim that the shape distortion is more perceptible than area distortion, and quantify such perceived foreshortening as the non-uniformity across the image, of the ratio e of the differential areas of an object in the scene and its projection. We also categorize foreshortening into uniform and non-uniform foreshortening. Uniform foreshortening is perceived by our visual system as a distortion, even if e is uniform across the image, only when comparative objects of known sizes are present in the image. Non-uniform foreshortening is perceived when there is no other depth cue in the scene that can help the brain to correct for the distortion. We present a unified solution to correct these distortions in one or more non-occluded foreground objects by applying object-specific segmentation and affine transformation of the segmented camera image plane. Our method also ensures that the background undergoes minimal distortion and preserves background features during this process. This is achieved efficiently by solving Laplace's equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions, assisted by a simple and intuitive user interface.","","","10.1109/ICCPHOT.2016.7492868","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492868","","Cameras;Distortion;Face;Image segmentation;Shape;User interfaces;Visual systems","affine transforms;image segmentation","Laplace equations;camera image plane;computer graphics;nonuniform foreshortening;object specific planar transformations;object-specific segmentation;perceived perspective distortions;uniform foreshortening","","","","40","","","13-15 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet, the description of human hand motions is very complex, and methods to reduce this complexity have attracted much attention in the motor control literature. Important implications in robot hand design and programming have also generated a wide interest in the robotics research community. Early studies prevalently used direct analysis methods such as visual inspection to define grasp taxonomies. More recently, analytical methods have been employed to perform grasping data dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we present a methodology to reconcile these two distinct and apparently incompatible approaches under a unified framework: this allows us to obtain a data-generated grasp taxonomy along with low-dimensional representations which could be used for human grasping data classification and posture reconstruction, as well as for simplifying grasp planning algorithms and robotic hands programming.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7559106","","","","","","","","","","","21-22 June 2016","","VDE","VDE Conference Publications"

Thirdly, we solve the model and obtain the real global optimum applying an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, our case study shows that the established PPC model and its five sub-models are applicable to evaluate the financial risk of CCBs.

"20 nm FDSOI process and design platforms for high performance/ low power systems on chip","M. Haond","STMicroelectron., Crolles, France","SOI Conference (SOI), 2012 IEEE International","","2012","","","1","2","The race towards further density increase in CMOS circuit integration is entering a new era where choices are needed for the device shrink. Beyond 20nm, a consensus says that MOSFETs will go fully depleted. They can either be 2D or 3D, i.e. 2D fully depleted silicon films on Oxide (FDSOI) or 3D with fully depleted silicon fins. We believe that FDSOI films allow continuing smoothly Moore's Law without introducing drastic design disruptive steps. We have developed FDSOI Process and Design Platforms that are in the shrink trend from previous generations. Moreover, since FDSOI devices are compatible with the Bulk design rules and constraints, it becomes possible, within the same technology node, to hit the performance boost usually targeted with the next one. This has become of utmost importance today where the introduction of a new node gets complex and costly because of the delay to get appropriate advanced Lithography tools. In this presentation, we review the challenges for the 20nm FDSOI nodes by looking at performance, power and process complexity.","1078-621X;1078621X","","10.1109/SOI.2012.6404361","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6404361","","Complexity theory;Films;Logic gates;Performance evaluation;Silicon;Silicon germanium;Very large scale integration","CMOS integrated circuits;MOSFET;integrated circuit design;low-power electronics;silicon-on-insulator;system-on-chip","2D fully depleted silicon films on oxide;3D fully depleted silicon fins;CMOS circuit integration;FDSOI devices;FDSOI process;MOSFET;Moore law;advanced lithography tools;bulk design rules;low power system-on-chip design platform;size 20 nm","","0","","5","","","1-4 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Statistical pattern analysis assisted selection of polymers for odor sensor array","S. K. Jha; R. D. S. Yadava","Dept. of Phys., Banaras Hindu Univ., Varanasi, India","Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies (ICSCCN), 2011 International Conference on","","2011","","","575","580","This paper demonstrates application and usefulness of multivariate statistical methods like principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) for design and development of polymer coated acoustic wave (surface and bulk) vapor sensor array. Individual sensors in the array are functionalized with different polymers having varied selectivities towards chemical constituents of odor samples. In response to an odor sample a response pattern is generated analogous to olfactory epithelium in human nose. The pattern recognition algorithms extract vapor identification signatures similar to signal processing in biological nose. The successful operation of such an artificial nose system depends critically on the polymer coating materials that sensitize individual sensors so that the response patterns carry most discriminating information about vapor identities. The objective of this work is to show that the process of polymer selection and sensor array development can be made efficient by exploiting the existing vapor-polymer interaction databases through statistical data mining procedures and sensor array simulation for target vapor detection and identification. A prototype case study of polymer coated surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor array for discrimination of human body odor is presented. The detection of 14 major volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emanating from different parts of human body (skin, breath, blood, armpit) has been targeted. The available information about vapor-polymer partition coefficients is analyzed by PCA and HCA methods to select most efficient polymers. Out of 22 commercial and synthesized potential polymers for this purpose we found that a subset of 3 polymers: alkyl-amino-pyridyl substituted polysiloxane (SXPYR), poly4-hexafluoroisopropanol-styrene (P4V) and poly ethylenimine (PEI), produces the most optimal discrimination between different odor constituents.","","","10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6024617","Body odor identification;electronic nose;polymer coating selection;surface acoustic wave odor sensor array","Additives;Chemicals;Ethanol;Plastics;Polymers;Principal component analysis;Reliability","bulk acoustic wave devices;chemioception;electronic noses;pattern recognition equipment;polymers;principal component analysis;sensor arrays;statistical analysis;surface acoustic wave sensors","P4V;PEI;SAW sensor array;SXPYR;alkyl-amino-pyridyl substituted polysiloxane;biological nose;bulk acoustic wave vapor sensor array;hierarchical cluster analysis;human body odor;human nose;odor sensor array;olfactory epithelium;pattern recognition algorithms;poly ethylenimine;poly4-hexafluoroisopropanol-styrene;polymer coated acoustic wave vapor sensor array;principal component analysis;signal processing;statistical data mining;surface acoustic wave vapor sensor array;vapor identification signature;vapor-polymer interaction;volatile organic compounds","","0","","30","","","21-22 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as a typical example is starting to be analyzed with facial expressions videos to detect emotions. Emotions play an important role in the daily life of human beings, the need and importance of automatic emotion recognition has grown with increasing role of human computer interface applications. In this paper, we concentrate on recognition of the emotions jointly from ""inner"" and ""outer"" reactions, which are electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and facial expression video. Due to the streaming nature of this problem, the data volume and velocity is very challenging. We address these challenges from the theoretic perspective and propose a real time algorithm based on EEG signals and synchronized facial video to learn feature vector jointly. Our algorithm consists of an unsupervisedly EEG dictionary component based on deep learning theorem, and a probability pooling component transforms a continuous sequential signal into an EEG ""sentence"" which consists of a sequence of EEG words. The EEG sentence is then jointly learned with video features into a new fixed length feature representation for emotion classification. We overcome several computational challenges on the data based on the idea of convolution and pooling, and we conduct extensive evaluation for each component of our model. We also demonstrate the state-of-the-art classification result on real-world dataset. The superior performances on the emotion recognition task indicates that 1) the natural language scenario can be applied in EEG sequences and 2) borrowing video modality can increase the overall performance.","","","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363831","Classification;Data stream;EEG;Feature Learning","Dictionaries;Electroencephalography;Emotion recognition;Physiology;Streaming media;Synchronization;Transforms","electroencephalography;emotion recognition;face recognition;medical image processing;probability;video signal processing","EEG dictionary component;EEG feature learning;automatic emotion recognition;deep learning theorem;electroencephalogram signal;emotion classification;emotion detection;facial expression video;feature vector;human computer interface;natural language;physiological analysis;probability pooling component;synchronized facial video;video modality","","","","10","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This feature allows the designer to switch the context of a specific circuit region without any interruption in the other components, but it has also increased the level of expertise needed for their design. In this paper we introduce a Run Time Manager (RTM) able to map multiple applications on the underlying architecture and execute them concurrently. In order to ensure the RTM portability on different designs, it has been structured so that it is independent from the architecture description. It is illustrated how (1) this RTM can be automatically generated starting from the source code of the input applications, (2) its modular implementation combined with the use of partial reconfiguration allows the user to explore different policies.

The proposed inventory tracking system prototype is aimed at the company's agents whose responsibilities are to track and manage the retailer's merchandise as it flows between suppliers and consumers. The system can eliminate inefficiencies in the process of tracking inventory and orders processing, while doing so with minimal economic cost by utilizing inexpensive cell phones from one side and inexpensive web hosting in the cloud on the other side. This means to use inexpensive options in terms of both hardware and software, and services in the cloud for data processing and storage as well as to automate the process of physically tracking inventory so less time is spent on this particular task. Such a system with further development can also address business critical question of monitoring sales personnel adherence to the assigned sales routes, collection of other information from the retail outlets (products distribution, pricing, shelving, out-of-stock situations etc.). There are several areas where the proposed solution can be used: on-shelf availability check and inventory calculation (used both by retailers' personnel and by the manufacturer's sales force); orders taking (to automate the process); retail audit (used by the specialized commercial or governmental agencies) and by consumer protection rights agencies. From the technical point of view the goal is to investigate the available open source solutions so they may be integrated with a new proposed system for business utilization.

Traditional design tools reflect this approach. Kinetic architecture, however, defines a kind of architecture that incorporates dynamic properties which accommodate for environmental or utilization changes. The integration of mechanics, electronics, and computer technology into contemporary architectural design, requires a change of thinking and designing, as well as suitable design tools. To communicate design ideas, the architectural design process utilizes effective strategies such as sketching and model building. A well-established design technique in diverse disciplines is rapid prototyping. Our goal is to have an integrated environment for designing kinetic architecture, including its mechanical parts, electronic units, and software modules with a rapid prototyping approach. This paper discusses conceptual ideas for rapid prototyping design environments for kinetic architecture. An exemplary environment is introduced where a small design task has been realized to provide feedback for the concept.","2326-8123;23268123","","10.1109/ICCIS.2015.7274607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274607","design process;kinetic architecture;rapid prototyping","Architecture;Buildings;Computer architecture;Kinetic theory;Prototypes;Software;Virtual environments","architecture;buildings (structures)","architectural design process;computer technology;contemporary architectural design;design environment;design idea communication;design tools;dynamic properties;electronic units;environmental changes;kinetic architecture;mechanical parts;model building;rapid prototyping;sketching;software modules;static building design;utilization changes","","","","25","","","15-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to support hospital decision makers for technology procurement planning, an expert model was designed as reported in the following paper. It combines the most widely used approaches for technology evaluation by taking into consideration Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Medical Equipment Replacement Model (MERM). The designing phases include a first definition of prioritization algorithms, then the weighting process through experts' interviews and a final step for the model validation that included both statistical testing and comparison with real decisions. In conclusion, the designed model was able to provide a semi-automated tool that through the use of multidisciplinary information is able to prioritize different requests of technology acquisition in hospitals.

Due to the lack of available protocols to route traffic through middleboxes, operators still rely on error-prone and complex low-level configurations to coerce traffic through the desired set of middleboxes. Built upon the recent software-defined networking (SDN) architecture and OpenFlow protocol, this paper proposes StEERING, short for SDN inlinE sERvices and forwardlNG. It is a scalable framework for dynamically routing traffic through any sequence of middleboxes. With simple centralized configuration, StEERING can explicitly steer different types of flows through the desired set of middleboxes, scaling at the level of per-subscriber and per-application policies. With its capability to support flexible routing, we further propose an algorithm to select the best locations for placing services, such that the performance is optimized. Overall, StEERING allows network operators to monetize their middlebox deployment in new ways by allowing subscribers flexibly to select available network services.","1092-1648;10921648","","10.1109/ICNP.2013.6733615","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6733615","","Internet;Switches","computer networks;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","OpenFlow protocol;SDN architecture;SDN inline services and forwardlng;StEERING;broadband access;complex low-level configurations;data center;dynamic routing traffic;enterprise networks;firewalls;inline service chaining;middleboxes management;network operators;network services;per-application policy;per-subscriber policy;protocols;software-defined networking","","25","8","27","","","7-10 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An agent-based modeling approach to creating more resilient littoral combat architectures","J. Behmer; K. Ogunsina; P. Shah; S. Srinivasan","School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference","","2016","","","1","9","Littoral combat is a critical component of naval warfare that has gained importance since the late 20th century due to a shift from matched blue-water combat to agile, asymmetric warfare near the coast. With the increased relevance of this type of naval combat, the ability of a networked naval warfare System-of-Systems (SoS) to operate effectively given the challenges of operations in the littoral zone becomes imperative. Resilience in an SoS in the face of a variety of threats is vital. These threats may take various forms: traditional warfare, cyber attacks, or communications breakdowns. The challenge for any SoS practitioner is identifying such architectures from a vast design space. We define an architecture as the constituent systems in the SoS and the connections among these systems. We seek to apply an agent-based modeling approach to create an architecture evaluation tool that leverages the modular nature of an SoS to quickly conduct trade studies and analyses to identify architectures that are resilient to a variety of threats. The simulation tool is built on the principles of the Open Systems Architecture put forth by the Department of Defense (DoD). We present an analysis that seeks to find a suitable SoS architecture configuration that maintains operability and performance during the loss of command authorities. This loss can be attributed to battle casualties or other forms of threats including communications failures. We demonstrate that distributing managerial control in the architecture improves, to some extent, SoS performance in terms of time to threat elimination. This single analysis demonstrates how SoS practitioners can use agent-based models to quickly construct and evaluate potential architectures against a variety of threats and disruptions, ultimately building resilient SoS architectures that perform to prescribed levels even in the face of network failures and attacks.","","","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500743","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500743","","Agent-based modeling;Analytical models;Architecture;Biological system modeling;Context;Numerical models","military computing;multi-agent systems;open systems","Department of Defense;DoD;agent-based modeling approach;architecture evaluation tool;asymmetric warfare;blue-water combat;command authorities;littoral combat architecture;naval combat;naval warfare;networked naval warfare system-of-systems;open systems architecture;resilient SoS architectures","","","","17","","","5-12 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, It derives the differential equations correspond with the equivalent circuits of the PV system and extends the frame of the model which can contain the positive negative and zero sequence (PNZ-seq.) network. The converter block is redesigned to provide an interface between the PV system and the multiphase (balanced or unbalanced) network. Then, it emphasis on the control block which dictates the active and reactive power to be delivered based on command. The innovative improvement is to consider the P-Seq. and N-Seq. coordination control strategy for RMS unbalance simulation. Finally, the improved model is implemented in the DIgSILENT PowerFactory software.

Shape models aid in the representation and recognition of arbitrarily complex shapes. This paper proposes a fast and computationally efficient narrow band level set algorithm for recovering arbitrary shapes of objects from various types of image data. The overall computational cost is reduced by using a five grid point wide narrow band applied on a variational level set formulation that can be easily implemented by simple finite difference scheme. The proposed method is more efficient and has many advantages when compared to traditional level set formulations. The periodical reinitialization of the level set function to a signed distance function is completely avoided. Implementation by simple finite difference scheme reduces computational complexity and ensures faster curve evolution. The level set function is initialized to an arbitrary region in the image domain. The region based initialization is computationally more efficient and flexible. This formulation can form the basis of a shape modeling scheme for implementing solid modeling techniques on free form shapes set in a level set framework. The proposed method has been applied to extract shapes from both synthetic and real images including some low contrast medical images, with promising results.","","","10.1109/ICADIWT.2014.6814664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814664","level set method;narrow band;shape modeling","Active contours;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Level set;Mathematical model;Shape;Solid modeling","computational complexity;computer vision;feature extraction;finite difference methods;image representation;medical image processing;set theory;shape recognition;solid modelling","arbitrarily complex shape recognition;arbitrarily complex shape representation;computational complexity;computer graphics;computer vision;curve evolution;fast narrow band level set formulation;finite difference scheme;grid point wide narrow band;level set function;low contrast medical images;shape extraction;shape modeling scheme;solid modeling techniques;variational level set formulation","","0","","27","","","17-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This optimum interval may vary, depending on cleaning costs, as well as seasonal variations in soiling loss and energy production. In this work, a general expression has been derived for the optimal cleaning interval and then applied to losses actually observed over a one-year interval at a test site in central Saudi Arabia and fitted to a simple exponential loss model. The results show that costs attributable to cleaning to an optimum schedule are a small fraction of typical operation and maintenance costs even for completely manual cleaning, and even more so with machine-assisted cleaning.","2156-3381;21563381","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2016.2535308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7431986","Cleaning;desert;levelized cost of energy (LCOE);photovoltaic (PV);soiling;solar","Cleaning;Loss measurement;Photovoltaic systems;Soil;Soil measurements;Temperature measurement","photovoltaic power systems;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;soil","PV systems;central Saudi Arabia;economic cost;energy loss;energy production;exponential loss model;levelized cost of electricity;machine-assisted cleaning;maintenance costs;observed soiling conditions;optimized cleaning cost;optimum cleaning interval;photovoltaic plants;soil accumulation;soiling loss","","1","","24","","20160311","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We implemented an active touch behavior and experimentally investigated its effect on motivation. In the experiment, a robot requested participants to perform a monotonous task with a robot's active touch, a passive touch, or no touch. The result of experiment showed that an active touch by a robot increased the number of working actions and the amount of working time for the task. This suggests that a robot's active touch can support people to improve their motivation.

Unlike CPUs, these processors have a large register file and on-chip scratchpad memory, which consume a significant portion of compute core power (35%-45%). In this paper, we introduce novel throughput architecture by integrating resistive memory (Spin Transfer Torque RAM) inside the compute core, which reduces leakage significantly, but introduces write power overhead and longer write latencies in GPU shared memory and register file accesses. We enhance the compute core by introducing register file organization with differential memory update mechanism to remove update redundancy during write operations. Furthermore, using merged register-write-mechanism and write-back buffer, we coalesce multithreaded GPU register write accesses to save write energy. In addition, we introduce hybrid shared memory design using SRAM and STT-MRAM that provides significant leakage/dynamic power savings without affecting performance. On average, across 23 GPGPU/graphics workloads, our schemes save 46% dynamic power due to register access (83% leakage power saving) with negligible performance degradation. On average, hybrid shared memory provides 10% reduction in dynamic power with maximum 1.6× performance improvement for the current workloads at no additional area overhead.","1530-0897;15300897","","10.1109/HPCA.2013.6522331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522331","","Arrays;Graphics processing units;Magnetic tunneling;Random access memory;Registers;System-on-chip","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;cache storage;graphics processing units;multi-threading;optimising compilers;parallel memories;performance evaluation;power aware computing;shared memory systems","GPGPU-graphics workloads;GPU shared memory;SRAM;STT-MRAM;caches;differential memory update mechanism;dynamic power;hybrid shared memory design;leakage-dynamic power savings;multithreaded GPU register write accesses;myriad memory accesses;off-chip DRAM;on-chip scratchpad memory;parallel computing;performance degradation;performance improvement;power-performance cooptimization;register file accesses;register file organization;register-write-mechanism;resistive memory;spin transfer torque RAM;throughput architecture;throughput computers;throughput core architecture;write latencies;write power overhead;write-back buffer","","17","","46","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The electroless Ni plating can compensate for the bump height variation of 1.9 μm in a chip with filling the gap between the Cu-pillar bump and Cu-micro-stud structure.

As a result, the stability criterion based on these impedances is an effective way to check the stability of system.

The aptamer inhibitors create an overall positive loop, where regulation is achieved by modulating the activity of the polymerases rather than the promoter activity. Inhibition occurs via stoichiometric binding of RNA monomers to enzymes and is not a cooperative phenomenon; the only nonlinearities in the differential equations are given by second order reaction rates. Enzyme activity is recovered in the presence of DNA strands that displace the aptamers from their target, and mediate their degradation; recovery is also a bimolecular binding process. Numerical analysis shows that the system admits bistability in a wide range of parameters.","","","10.1109/CDC.2015.7402819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7402819","","Biochemistry;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;In vitro;Jacobian matrices;Mathematical model;RNA;Switches","DNA;RNA;differential equations;molecular biophysics;stoichiometry","RNA aptamer inhibitor;RNA monomer stoichiometric binding;RNA polymerases;bimolecular binding process;bistable biomolecular network;differential equations;enzyme activity;in vitro transcription;monomeric inhibition reactions;nucleic acid strand displacement reactions;numerical analysis;second order reaction rates;stoichiometric binding;synthetic RNA-based biochemical toggle switch;system structure","","","","21","","","15-18 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the effect of these delay variations is not uniformly spread across functional units and instructions: some are affected more (hence less reliable) than others. This paper proposes a NBTI-aware compiler-directed very long instruction word (VLIW) assignment scheme that uniformly distributes the stress of instructions with the aim of minimizing aging of GPGPU architecture without any performance penalty. The proposed solution is an entirely software technique based on static workload characterization and online execution with NBTI monitoring that equalizes the expected lifetime of each processing element by regenerating aging-aware healthy kernels that respond to the specific health state of GPGPU. We demonstrate our approach on AMD Evergreen architecture where iso-throughput executions of the healthy kernels reduce NBTI-induced voltage threshold shift up to 49% (11%) compared to naïve kernel executions, with (without) architectural support for power-gating. The kernel adaption flow takes average of 13 millisecond on a typical host machine thus making it suitable for practical implementation.","0738-100X;0738100X","","10.1145/2463209.2488754","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560609","Adaptive Kernel;Aging-aware Compilation;Dynamic Binary Optimizer;GPGPU;NBTI;VLIW","Aging;Computer architecture;Degradation;Kernel;Sensors;Stress;VLIW","graphics processing units;instruction sets;negative bias temperature instability;operating system kernels;parallel architectures;program compilers","AMD Evergreen architecture;GPGPU architectures;NBTI monitoring;NBTI-aware compiler-directed very long instruction word assignment scheme;NBTI-induced voltage threshold shift reduction;aging minimization;aging-aware compiler-directed VLIW assignment;aging-aware healthy kernel regeneration;delay variation effect;delay-induced faults;functional units;general purpose graphical processing units;host machine;kernel adaption flow;naïve kernel executions;negative bias temperature instability;online execution;power-gating;processor reliability;software technique;static workload characterization","","9","","29","","","May 29 2013-June 7 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In aggressive environments, gold provides adequate resistance for corrosion of underneath copper. Corrosion resistance has been historically studied by exposing the connectors to a mixture of corrosive gases through a mixed flowing gas (MFG) test. A few studies in the past claimed that contact electrical resistance can stay stable even in unplated samples if micromotion between the interfaces can be eliminated. However, contact force relaxation and micromotion can disturb the mating interface resulting in resistance increases. To understand the interactions between surface finish plating, end usage and micromotion under an aggressive environment, a DOE was planned with linear edge connectors in a MFG chamber. The effect of end usage was addressed through mated and unmated connector samples followed by electrical testing. The impact of mechanical force was studied by controlling the micromotion through a custom vibration fixture that was designed to operate within the MFG chamber. Results from our studies are expected to initiate efforts towards improving existing industry test standards with recommendation to consider the effects of mechanical retention and end usage in addition to plating material and thickness.","","","10.1109/HOLM.2015.7355115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7355115","Connector;Contact Resistance;Creep Corrosion;MFG;Plating Micromotion;component","Connectors;Contacts;Corrosion;Gold;Nickel;Resistance;Vibrations","contact resistance;corrosion;electric connectors;electrical contacts;testing","contact force relaxation;contact resistance;corrosion resistance;corrosive environment;electrical resistance;electrical testing;infrequently mated connectors;linear edge connectors;mixed flowing gas test;optimum electrical properties;separable connectors;unmated connector","","","","16","","","11-14 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current telecommunication (TLC) networks offer (built-in) or allow several mechanisms to enhance security and reliability of human conversations, leveraging strong authentication mechanisms and cryptography. However, in most cases these solutions require complex deployments, mainly based on proprietary technologies which are often characterized by high costs and low flexibility. In this paper we present a solution for strong peers authentication and non-repudiability of human conversations through Voice over IP (VoIP) networks. Our solution achieves low costs and high interoperability as it is built on top of open standard technologies.

What happens when a technology is designed in one culture and used in another? What happens, for example, when a Chinese user is confronted by Roman-alphabet-embedded interfaces? In this book, Basile Zimmermann examines the relationship between technical objects and culture in contemporary China, drawing on concepts from science and technology studies (STS).

Zimmermann discusses well-known frameworks from STS and combines them with propositions and topics from Chinese studies. Each of the case studies advances his theoretical argument.

However, current state-of-the-art approaches perform poorly in practice due to their requirement of mobility prediction and specific assumptions on network topology. In this paper, we focus on lowdelay and high-throughput opportunistic data collection in WSN-MSs with general network topologies and arbitrary numbers of mobile sinks. We first propose a novel routing metric, Contact-Aware ETX (CA-ETX), to estimate the packet transmission delay caused by both packet retransmissions and intermittent connectivity. By implementing CA-ETX in the defacto TinyOS routing standard CTP and the IETF IPv6 routing protocol RPL, we demonstrate that CA-ETX can work seamlessly with ETX. This means that current ETXbased routing protocols for static WSNs can be easily extended to WSN-MSs with minimal modification by using CA-ETX. Further, by combing CA-ETX with the dynamic backpressure routing, we present a throughput-optimal scheme Opportunistic Backpressure Collection (OBC). Both CA-ETX and OBC are lightweight, easy to implement, and require no mobility prediction. Through test-bed experiments and extensive simulations, we show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform current approaches in terms of packet transmission delay, communication overhead, storage overheads, reliability, and scalability.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2016.2595574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524719","delay tolerant sensing;opportunistic networks;queueing networks;sensor data collection","Data collection;Delays;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","20160728","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Indeed, it enables to cope with complex user's requirements that require the collaboration of several more elementary services. However, with the increasing amount of candidate services of each business task that offer different QoS (Quality of Service) values, the selection of the optimal combination of services becomes a very hard task. This problem is more complex when dealing with temporal properties of business processes associated with time-dependent QoS parameters that can change according to the execution time. Unlike static QoS which have been deeply studied in the existing service selection approaches, time-dependent QoS are insufficiently taken into consideration. In this paper, we are interested in the problem of service selection to satisfy a given business process while considering temporal properties associated to time-dependent QoS. The selection approach that we propose relies on a new service pruning approach that is applied prior to our selection algorithm to reduce the number of candidate services while guaranteeing that the optimal solution still be found.","","","10.1109/ICWS.2014.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928875","Business process;Multi-objective optimization;Pruning;Service selection;Time-dependent QoS","Abstracts;Additives;Availability;Business;Manufacturing;Optimization;Quality of service","Web services;optimisation;quality of service;temporal databases","business processes;execution time;multiobjective optimization;quality-of-service;service pruning approach;service selection approach;temporal constraints;time-dependent QoS parameters","","3","","15","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The resistance network for the magnet is then reconstructed by dividing it into a number of nodes and branches. The sources in the resistance network are based on the time derivative of the flux density on the permanent magnet (PM) surface. The field solution is analyzed in the frequency domain and the magnetic resistance network is solved for each frequency.

To tackle this issue, there is an approach that provides tolerance for disruptions or disconnections in the network architecture, in which proxy functions in the network and the mobile node conceal the disruption of the wireless link from users and application servers. After the wireless link is re-established, the services the user enjoys are resumed. However, even if such a disruption-tolerant function avoids the direct negative effects of a disruption, i.e., the sudden end of an application session, the services could still end due to an application idle timer. In this paper, we propose a dynamic buffering method, named application idle timer retardation buffering (ARB), to deal with the application idle timeout issue. The proxy function in a mobile node has a buffer for incoming data from the network and queues data for only a brief moment before forwarding it to an application. When link connectivity is lost, the proxy function forwards queued data to the end-user application at a very low rate in order to delay application idle timer expiration by repeatedly resetting the timer. We implemented ARB in PCs and conducted field tests. The results of the ARB field test indicate that ARB maintains continuity despite communication interruptions as much as eleven times longer than could be handled without it, without throughput degradation.","2154-0217;21540217","","10.1109/ISWCS.2011.6125433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125433","Challenged network;Idle timer retardance;Service resumption;idle timer extension","IP networks;Manganese;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Servers;Throughput;Wireless communication","mobile radio;radio links;telecommunication services","ARB field test;application idle timer retardation buffering;challenged network environments;delay application idle timer expiration;disruption-tolerant function;dynamic buffering method;link connectivity;mobile node;mobile services;retarding application idle timer expiration;service resumption;wireless link","","0","","5","","","6-9 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the origins of the mobile accesses are frequently changed over time, moving services closer to client locations not only reduces the service access latency but also minimizes the network cost for service providers. However, these benefits do not come without compromise. The migration comes at cost of bulk-data transfer and service disruption, as a result, increasing the overall service costs. In this paper, we study the problem of dynamically migrating a service in Clouds to satisfy a sequence of mobile batch-request demands in a cost effective way. More specifically, to gain the benefits of service migration while minimizing the increased monetary costs, we propose a search-based dynamic migration algorithm that can effectively migrate a single or multiple servers to adapt to the changes of access patterns with minimum service costs. The algorithm is characterized by effective uses of historical access information to conduct virtual moves of a set of servers as a whole under a certain condition so as to overcome the limitations of local search in cost reduction.","1552-5244;15525244","","10.1109/CLUSTER.2013.6702646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6702646","","Heuristic algorithms","cloud computing;cost reduction;mobile computing;quality of service","QoS enhancement;bulk-data transfer;cloud;cost effectiveness enhancement;cost reduction;historical access information;mobile accesses;mobile batch-request demands;monetary cost minimisation;network cost minimisation;search-based dynamic migration algorithm;server migration;service access latency reduction;service disruption;service migration","","1","","14","","","23-27 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in practice maintaining consistency at all times is an intractable problem. Accordingly, recent paradigms for inconsistency management acknowledge that it is sometimes desirable to tolerate inconsistency, e.g. to allow distributed teamwork and prevent premature commitment to design decisions. However, a successful adoption of inconsistency managment paradigms in industry depends highly on the human factor: intolerant attitudes of practitioners toward inconsistency may pose significant barriers to a wider acceptance of these paradigms. A thorough analysis of cognitive factors is a key to overcoming these barriers. This paper reports on our preliminary empirical findings highlighting existing perceptions and attitudes of practitioners toward inconsistency, and propose dimensions for their classification. Based on these results, we outline a general research program for exploring cognitive factors in inconsistency management.","1090-705X;1090705X","","10.1109/RE.2015.7320427","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320427","IS development;Inconsistency management;human factors;method adoption","Context;Decision making;Encoding;Industries;Information systems;Software;Software engineering","cognition;formal specification;human factors","cognitive factors;inconsistency management;requirements engineering","","","","15","","","24-28 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Networks are becoming more complex, with a growing number of Equal Cost MultiPath (ECMP) and link bundles. Hence, some data-plane problems (e.g. silent packet dropping at one router) can hardly be detected with control-plane protocols or simple monitoring tools like ping or traceroute. In this paper, we propose a new technique, called SCMon, that enables continuous monitoring of the data-plane, in order to track the health of all routers and links. SCMon leverages the recently proposed Segment Routing (SR) architecture to monitor the entire network with a single box (and no additional monitoring protocol). In particular, SCMon uses SR to (i) force monitoring probes to travel over cycles; and (ii) test parallel links and bundles at a per-link granularity. We present original algorithms to compute cycles that cover all network links with a limited number of SR segments. Further, we prototype and evaluate SCMon both with simulations and Linux-based emulations. Our experiments show that SCMon quickly detects and precisely pinpoints data-plane problems, with a limited overhead.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9953-1; POD:978-1-4673-9954-8","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524410","","Monitoring;Network topology;Probes;Routing;Routing protocols;Topology","telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing","Linux;SCMon;control-plane protocols;data-plane continuous monitoring;equal cost multipath;interface cards;link failures;network monitoring;segment routing architecture;silent packet dropping","","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we compared an anatomically based model of the thigh with its corresponding cylindrically based model to study the difference in nerve activation with respect to stimulation site, the role of fat thickness, bone location, and the presence of the sciatic nerve and blood vessels. As a result, it is clear that the location of the femur and the non-uniformity of fat thickness through different stimulation sites make it difficult to use a cylindrically based model to predict nerve activation in the same way as with the anatomically based model.

In this paper, a new kind of security system based on a cipher and authentication algorithm called EDCA is presented to ensure the necessary security requirements with low computation complexity. Furthermore, the proposed cipher is based on a dynamic binary diffusion layer. The contents of packets is divided into many blocks, which are mixed together to produce the cipher blocks. Likewise, an enhanced version of cipher is presented to attain a better statistical properties.

The main advantage of the method is the need of discretization only along the azimuthal and the axial directions by sampling the fields and current densities in the interfaces between dielectric layers. The solution in the radial direction is obtained analytically with the dyadic Green's function, which is calculated using the full-wave equivalent circuit (FWEC) in the spectral domain. The method is used to analyze two structures: a multilayer conformal transmission line and a conformal antenna.

"Iterative carrier recovery in an LDPC coded QPSK system at low SNRs","J. Bao; X. Gao; C. Liu; B. Jiang","Nat. Mobile Commun. Res. Lab., Southeast Univ., Nanjing, China","Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP), 2015 International Conference on","","2015","","","1","5","This paper presents an iterative carrier recovery (ICR) via soft decision metrics (SDMs) of low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding in an LDPC coded quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) system. It is crucial for wireless communication systems to work effectively, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). By maximizing the sum of the square of the SDMs of LDPC decoding with gradient oriented optimization of the objective function, it adaptively updates the carrier phase and frequency parameter accurately. The structure of the proposed scheme is also given, along with the phase ambiguity solution. Meanwhile, it is combined with the Costas loop tracking and the LDPC decoding feedback to eliminate residual carrier offsets. Simulation results indicate that the proposed ICR algorithm achieves good performance in an LDPC coded QPSK system under rather large carrier phase offsets, which is just within 0.1 dB of the ideal code performance at the cost of some moderate complexity. By the proposed scheme, a rate-1/2 LDPC coded QPSK system can even work at low bit SNR (E<sub>b</sub>/N<sub>0</sub>) about 1-2 dB, which is useful in energy-limited wireless communications.","","","10.1109/WCSP.2015.7340999","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340999","LDPC codes;carrier synchronization;iterative carrier recovery;soft decision metrics","Approximation methods;Complexity theory;Iterative decoding;Linear programming;Maximum likelihood decoding;Phase shift keying","decoding;gradient methods;parity check codes;quadrature phase shift keying","Costas loop tracking;LDPC coded QPSK system;LDPC coded quadrature phase shift keying system;LDPC decoding feedback;carrier phase offsets;energy-limited wireless communications;frequency parameter;gradient oriented optimization;iterative carrier recovery;low-density parity-check decoding;phase ambiguity solution;residual carrier offsets;soft decision metrics;wireless communication systems","","","","12","","","15-17 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 0.01 singular value decomposition (SVD) threshold was selected based on experiences in circuit analysis. Under this SVD threshold, the result is accurate enough while it leads to more characteristic basis functions (CBFs), but much less accuracy.

Turning off (that is, duty cycling) sensors could reduce energy consumption, however, this would occur at the cost of low sensing fidelity due to sensing gaps introduced. Existing techniques focus mainly on scheduling a network with static anchors. Few methods provides a rigorous approach to confining sensing errors within desirable bounds while seeking to optimize the tradeoff between energy consumption and accuracy of predictions. In this work, we propose a sensing scheduling scheme, called MAS, to support mobile anchors in sensor networks. Within a node, we use a sensing probability bound to control tolerable sensing errors. While communicating with the mobile anchor, nodes trigger additional sensing activities to accommodate the QoS requirement in mobile communication. We validated the concept by constructing a lab-grade mobile anchor that fully supports 4G-LTE communications for monitoring applications. We further conducted simulations to investigate system performance. The simulation results demonstrated that the MAS achieved enhancement performance compared to several other sensing schemes.","2155-6806;21556806","","10.1109/MASS.2013.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680302","","Energy consumption;Error correction;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Quality of service;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","4G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;energy consumption;quality of service;scheduling;wireless sensor networks","4G-LTE communications;QoS requirement;duty cycling sensors;energy constraint;energy consumption;lab-grade mobile anchor;mobile anchor assisted error bounded sensing;mobile communication;monitoring applications;scheduling scheme;sensing activities;sensor networks;system performance;tolerable sensing errors;wireless sensor network","","1","","15","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since real-life tutoring in 1-to-1 scenarios proves to have the ultimate learning gain factor of 2 sigma [7]; the tutor model planted in example tracing is very limited compared to real life tutor behavior. In this paper we present a novel tutor modeling technique that records instructional behavior and scaffolding scenarios on top of example tracing and student responses. The model is designed conforming to the standard teacher and student dialogue moves [8] and in a way that allows evolving the information in the model while it is being used. A set of 3 face to face lectures each with 10 problems in math, has been logged and analyzed to extract the principle moves of the instructor strategies and related keywords.

The enforcing of a transmission is done by means of bringing up an auxiliary GSM-network. The configuration of the GSM-network allows the usage of a special handover procedure with frequency hopping. The implementation of frequency hopping considerably increases the accuracy of applied localization techniques.","2167-8022;21678022","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5760752","GSM;base stations;cellular networks;cellular phones;radio transceivers","Accuracy;Base stations;GSM;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Mobile handsets;Software","cellular radio;disasters;mobility management (mobile radio)","GSM network;disaster scenarios;frequency hopping;mobile phone localization","","4","","9","","","14-16 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This increases the importance of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) among the consumers which in turn led to the expansion of microgrid. Microgrid operates in grid-connected mode as well as in islanded mode. Microgrid is connected to main grid in grid connected mode. In islanded mode, there is no such connection and hence the microgrid operates independently. Microgrid may move to islanded mode intentionally or unintentionally. Power in the grid is not constant which in turn affected the loads connected to the grid. Due to the Sun light variation the voltage output from the grid may not be constant. In three phase microgrid, fault in one phase causes loss of voltage stability in other two phases. PID Control has been used for microgrid voltage control but it does not work properly during fault conditions. So, an adaptive PI controller has been proposed to provide voltage regulation in microgrid which provides better performance under all the circumstances. The performance of the system employing adaptive PI controller is validated using the results obtained from the MATLAB Simulink.","","","10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6922363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6922363","Adaptive Control;Islanded Operation;Microgrid;P-Q Theory","Capacitors;Inverters;Microgrids;Oscillators;Power generation;Reactive power;Voltage control","adaptive control;distributed power generation;three-term control;voltage control","PI controller;PID control;adaptive controller;distributed energy resources;islanded mode;microgrid;voltage regulation","","1","","12","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Systems need to not only be feasible but viable as well. That is, they need to be able to continue to provide value in spite of any potential exogenous or endogenous changes. Viability has been defined for other domains, but it has not been defined for engineered systems. This paper defines what it means for an engineered system to be viable and shows that it is related to, but different from, other existing “-ilities” such as survivability and reliability. This paper also addresses the need to ensure that endogenous changes do not inadvertently cause unintended interactions that harm the system overall. A new -ility, i.e., pliability, is introduced, which specifies the limits on how a system can change, without “breaking” or violating an architecture that was intended and validated. Like changeability, pliability increases robustness by allowing systems to voluntarily change in response to dynamic contexts and increases survivability by increasing the likelihood that unintentional changes are still within the set of allowable architecture-defined instances. It also distinguishes allowable changes from those that would require additional validation, reducing the effort required to get those changes approved by a diverse set of stakeholders.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2014.2314316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6805189","Pliability;reliability;resilience;survivability;system architecting;system engineering;systems of systems (SoSs)","Context;Missiles;Organizations;Resilience;Robustness;Uncertainty","reliability theory","architecture-defined instances;changing conditions;contextual variation;dynamic contexts;endogenous changes;exogenous changes;pliability systems;reliability;survivability;value maintainance;viable systems","","0","","47","","20140424","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

User-centric federated identity management (FIM) attends to the privacy issue by enabling users to approve each data dissemination between the providers of identity-related information, so-called identity providers (IdPs), and the consumers of this information, the service providers (SPs). Furthermore, user-centric FIM tries to improve security and usability by providing users with a consistent digital-identity experience using so-called information cards (InfoCards). The InfoCard-based approach can help to improve usability, privacy and security, however, the approach is limited to front-channel communication and requires that each data exchange is manually approved by the user. A back-channel communication might be required in scenarios, in which an IdP wants to notify SPs about e.g. a deactivation of a user. In [3] we proposed an approach, named User-Controlled Automated Identity Delegation, that allows a back-channel communication by automating user approval based on delegation.

For example, early detection of an epileptic seizure from sequential electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements would allow timely administration of anticonvulsant drugs or neurostimulation, thus reducing physical impairment and risks of overtreatment. We develop a Bayesian paradigm for state transition detection that combines optimal control and Markov processes. We define a hidden Markov model of the state evolution and develop a detection policy that minimizes a loss function of both probability of false positives and accuracy (i.e., lag between estimated and actual transition time). Our strategy automatically adapts to each newly acquired measurement based on the state evolution model and the relative loss for false positives and accuracy, thus resulting in a time varying threshold policy. The paradigm was used in two applications: 1) detection of movement onset (behavioral state) from subthalamic single unit recordings in Parkinson's disease patients performing a motor task; 2) early detection of an approaching seizure (clinical state) from multichannel intracranial EEG recordings in rodents treated with pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant.

In this paper, we propose a novel multiple access scheme for M2M communications based on the capacity-approaching analog fountain code to efficiently minimize the access delay and satisfy the delay requirement for each device. This is achieved by allowing M2M devices to transmit at the same time on the same channel in an optimal probabilistic manner based on their individual delay requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a near optimal rate performance and at the same time guarantees the delay requirements of the devices. We further propose a simple random access strategy and characterize the required overhead.

For the virtual or real commissioning of the system, further tasks like defining software or hardware communication interfaces are needed. Most engineering tools used by the software engineers only support one or few of the tasks. As a consequence, there is a great heterogeneous industrial tool landscape, which has to be applied in automation software engineering. Although every tool is specialized in its domain, there is plenty information about the system, for example parameters describing geometries or sensor/actuator signals, that are used by almost every domain. Currently, tool independent parameters are declared and defined in every tool redundantly. The possibility to declare and define parameters globally only once is missing. This fact increases the risk of inconsistency and the effort in software engineering. In this paper the approach of a consistent engineering information model to improve the consistency of information focused on parameters is introduced. The approach is implemented by Automation Markup Language (AutomationML). The evaluation is realized by the software engineering of a pneumatic double acting cylinder and shows the potential of accelerating the software engineering and improving consistency of parameters through introducing a consistent engineering information model.","1553-572X;1553572X","","10.1109/IECON.2014.7048862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7048862","AutomationML;consistency;mechatronic component;model driven engineering;parameters","Automation;Mathematical model;Mechatronics;Pistons;Software;Software engineering;XML","mechatronics;production engineering computing;programming;software engineering","Automation Markup Language;AutomationML;automation code programming;consistent engineering information model;hardware communication interface;heterogeneous industrial tool;mechatronic components;pneumatic double acting cylinder;production automation engineering;production automation systems;production system simulation;production system visualization;software communication interface","","1","","21","","","Oct. 29 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But current smart metering projects are facing barriers to adoption from consumers, arising from the failure of project sponsors to understand consumers and their requirements. Consumers view smart meters with suspicion, perceiving them to be energy suppliers' efforts to maximise their profits at the expense of consumer costs, choice, health and privacy. For emergent systems like automated metering infrastructure (AMI) to avoid battling to convince consumers of their benefits, it is essential to have user-centric analysis performed before expensive infrastructures are designed and deployed. Various categories of consumers will have their own particular perspectives, and different expectations about how the system should help them to appropriately manage their energy usage. Hence it is essential to segment energy consumers and identify the requirements for each group. In this paper we look at a number of user-centric methods. We then analyse the effectiveness of combining Contextual Design (CD), focus groups and problem extraction to provide insights into energy consumer needs. Based on the analysis we outline a functional specification for a smart meter that would satisfy the energy requirements for a segment of electricity consumer with medical needs.","2165-4816;21654816","","10.1109/ISGTEurope.2014.7028789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028789","Contextual Design;User centered design;consumer segments;requirement elicitation;smart meter","Business;Context;Electricity;Interviews;Relays;Smart grids;Smart meters","energy conservation;metering;smart meters","AMI;CD;automated metering infrastructure;consumer costs;consumer requirements;contextual design;electricity consumer;energy consumers;energy efficiency;smart meters;user-centric analysis","","0","","43","","","12-15 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most jet injectors are designed and used for the delivery of inviscid liquids, and are not optimized for the delivery of viscous drug compounds. To better understand the requirements for delivering viscous drugs, we have developed a mathematical model of the electromechanics of a moving-coil actuated jet injector as it delivers viscous fluids. Methods: The model builds upon previous work by incorporating the nonlinear electrical properties of the motor, compliant elements of the mechanical piston and ampoule system, and the effect of viscosity on injector characteristics. The model has been validated by monitoring the movement of the piston tip and measurements of the jet force. Results: The results of the model indicate that the jet speed is diminished with increasing fluid viscosity, but overshoot and ringing in the jet speed is unaffected. However, a stiffer ampoule and piston will allow for a better control of the jet speed profile during an injection, and reduce ringing. Conclusion: We identified that the piston friction coefficient, the compliance of the injector components, and the viscous properties of the fluid are important determinants of performance when jet-injecting viscous fluids. Significance: By expanding upon previous jet injector models, this study has provided informative simulations of jet injector characteristics and performance. The model can be used to guide the design of future jet injectors for viscous fluids.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2482967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7279074","Actuators;Biomedical electronics;Drug delivery;Fluid flow control;Viscosity","Force;Force measurement;Friction;Mathematical model;Pistons;Viscosity","","","","","","25","","20150928","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This work clarifies 3D thermal stress profiles under power cycling test (PCT) and thermal cycling test (TCT) with multi-physics solver for the system having Ag sintered bonding layer as a new chip attachment technology. Both reliability test results on Von Mises stress profile are compared and the key features for each test are made clear. It was found that the maximum stress values within Si chip and Ag sintered bonding layer are at the corner of bonding layer for both PCT and TCT. The maximum stress of bonding layer under PCT ON state at chip power of 400 W is lower than the value under TCT with Ta of 25 °C which is the Ta of PCT. Under PCT the temperature difference from stress free temperature (Tr) for bonding layer is smaller than that under TCT with Ta of 25 °C, and this results in lower thermal stress in bonding layer. The maximum stress value of Ag sintered layer is a little lower than the conventional solder value under both PCT and TCT. This smaller stress of Ag sintered layer is thought to be due to lower Young's modulus of the Ag sintered layer.","","","10.1109/ICEP.2016.7486906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7486906","Ag sintering;chip attachment;multi-physics solver;power cycling test;stress and strain analysis;thermal cycling test","Bonding;Heating;Reliability;Stress;Thermal analysis;Thermal conductivity;Thermal stresses","Young's modulus;cooling;elemental semiconductors;power semiconductor devices;semiconductor device reliability;semiconductor device testing;silicon;silver;sintering;thermal stresses;yield stress","3D thermal stress profiles;Ag;PCT;PCT on state;Si;TCT;Von Mises stress profile;Young modulus;chip bonding layer;maximum stress values;multiphysics solver;power 400 W;power cycling test;power device heat dissipation structures;power semiconductor device technology;reliability test;silicon chip;silver sintered bonding layer;silver sintering chip-attachment;stress free temperature;temperature 25 degC;temperature difference;thermal conductance;thermal cycling test;thermal stress concentration","","","","4","","","20-22 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, the technique of applying field grading material (FGM) is proposed for the designs of cable accessories and machine insulation, but fewer applications in HV bushing realm. In this paper, modeling of electric stress control in a simplified HV wall bushing is presented. The hollow insulator employs an artificial field grading material (FGM) with linear (constant) and nonlinear (field-dependent) conductivity, respectively. First, the electric stress control theory of FGM is analyzed. Then, the COMSOL Multiphysics is used to solve a numerical model of bushing. In the process, the FGM is equivalent to a thin layer of surface conduction. Hence, an additional term of surface current density is added into the boundary equation. The simulation model is calculated under dc and ac (50 Hz sinusoidal) voltages respectively with both linear and nonlinear FGM. At last, the application conditions and effects of using FGM for HV bushing are discussed.","0084-9162;00849162","","10.1109/CEIDP.2014.6995822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6995822","FEM;HV wall bushing;electric stress control;field grading material","Cable insulation;Electric potential;Insulators;Materials;Mathematical model;Stress control","boundary integral equations;bushings;current density;functionally graded materials;machine insulation;power cables;stress control;surface conductivity","AC voltage;COMSOL multiphysics;DC voltage;HV wall bushing;artificial FGM;boundary equation;cable accessories;electric stress control theory modeling;field grading material;hollow insulator;linear conductivity;machine insulation performance improvement;nonlinear conductivity;power device;surface conduction thin layer;surface current density","","1","","9","","","19-22 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, an Enterprise Service Bus specially tailored for the tactical domain (a “tactical ESB”) is used as a technical infrastructure for the SOA. On the network side, a “tactical router” provides connections to different radio technologies (e.g. VHF, HF based radios, satellite communication, etc.). A specially tailored cross-layer middleware is introduced to coordinate ESB (infrastructure) services with the tactical router. The middleware uses a specific state exchange mechanism in order to increase the efficiency of the overall system. Therefore, it obtains characteristics of the network environment and takes advantage of them in order to improve the quality of data transfers. In addition, a prototypical implementation of the architectural concept is briefly described. There, the designed components and interfaces were prototypically implemented and coupled with RuDi (an Apache CXF - based ESB by IABG [4]) and an in-house developed prototype of a tactical router.","","","10.1109/ICMCIS.2015.7158699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7158699","crosslayer architecture;middleware;tactical command and control information systems;tactical enterprise service bus;tactical router","Convergence;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols;Service-oriented architecture","Web services;middleware;military communication;military computing;radiocommunication;service-oriented architecture;telecommunication network routing","Apache CXF;RuDi;SOA services;Web services;architectural concept;cross-layer middleware;data transfers;enterprise service bus;low-bandwidth communication links;radio technologies;tactical ESB;tactical router","","1","","13","","","18-19 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article we use a multi-objective design space exploration tool called FADSE to explore the vast design space of the Grid Alu Processor (GAP) and its post-link optimizer called GAPtimize. We improved FADSE with techniques to make it more robust against failures and to speed up evaluations through parallel processing. For the GAP, we present an approximation of the hardware complexity as second objective besides execution time. Mining of functions applied as a whole program optimization with GAPtimize is used as example for a code optimization.

In many cases, their peak rate struggle to deliver HDTV video streams, which are widely acknowledged as one of the killer Internet applications in the near future. Fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) solutions are being deployed to address the problem of scarce capacity in the network access. However, their ability to increase access capacity by over two orders of magnitude could create substantial scalability problems as power consumption of current IP-centric network architectures in the metro and core nodes will scale linearly (or worse) with capacity increase. Long-reach passive optical networks were introduced as a solution to this scalability problem, since they considerably reduce cost and power consumption for network operators, by allowing optical bypass of a large number of metro nodes in the network. In this paper we report the results of a deployment study of a dual-parented protected, nation-wide LR-PON installation for Ireland and the UK, based on real dataset. We focus on further reducing the overall network power consumption by employing a protection mechanism that reduces the IP router capacity required for protection as well as the number of backup OLTs. We show that in a realistic LR-PON deployment up to a 40% reduction in power consumption can be achieved, compared to solutions adopting legacy 1+1 protection. This is accomplished by optimising the network deployment for energy efficient protection, and adopting a smart load balancing technique and a core node architecture that allows N:M protection of backup links.","","","10.1109/ONDM.2012.6210220","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6210220","","Blades;DSL;IP networks;Optical switches;Passive optical networks;Power demand","IP networks;digital subscriber lines;passive optical networks;resource allocation;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","DSL products;FTTP solutions;HDTV video streams;IP router;IP-centric network architectures;Internet;copper pair;core node architecture;energy efficient protected LR-PON architecture;fibre-to-the-premises solution;long-reach passive optical networks;metro nodes;network access capacity;network power consumption;protection mechanism;scalability problem;smart load balancing technique","","4","","10","","","17-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is commonly known that jamming pilot tones is more efficient than broadband attacks against an entire OFDM signal. This paper builds on this idea and introduces the pilot nulling attack, which is considerably more efficient than simple pilot jamming, by driving received pilot energy as close to zero as possible. This paper presents our channel and equalizer model, and then undertakes an analysis of OFDM under these attacks, verifying the assessment through simulation. For a target bit error rate of 0.4, QPSK underlying modulation, and pilot tone density of 1/8, we discover that pilot jamming is roughly 2 dB more efficient than barrage jamming, and pilot nulling is roughly 7.5 dB more efficient than barrage jamming. In all cases, pilot nulling is capable of fully denying the target signal at 4 dB of signal-to-jamming ratio by driving the QPSK bit error rate to 0.5.","1550-3607;15503607","","10.1109/icc.2011.5962467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962467","","AWGN;Bit error rate;Channel estimation;Jamming;OFDM;Signal to noise ratio;Synchronization","OFDM modulation;channel estimation;equalisers;error statistics;jamming;quadrature phase shift keying;telecommunication security","QPSK underlying modulation;barrage jamming;bit error rate;channel frequency response estimation;efficient OFDM denial;equalization;jamming pilot tones;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;pilot jamming;pilot nulling attack;pilot tone density;signal-to-jamming ratio","","30","","12","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It allows the designer to simulate substrate currents and check their effects on circuits functionality. The proposed methodology employs a dedicated tool for substrate network generation referred to as AUTOMICS. We applied the methodology on two test cases. The first case is a DC-DC buck converter chip fabricated with a 0.35 $mu$m HV-CMOS technology. The DC coupling current between the switches and the bandgap circuit is simulated and verified with measurements. The second test case is an automotive industrial chip that has a latch-up failure due to substrate coupling. In transient simulations, the failure has been reproduced as in measurements. This highlights the stronghold of the methodology since it can be used to prevent this type of failures before fabrication.

The system automatically switches between states based on the configuration of the manipulator. Testing is performed using the Omnibot MMS, a holonomic platform with a 3-DOF manipulator.

However, when data is modified for any replica, it must maintain the consistency for all replicas in Data Grid Environment, thus the similarity of the replicas. In addition, it must accelerate update propagation after each modification. This paper proposed a new approach called Efficient Replica Consistency Model (ERCM). The first contribution of this paper is handling optimal allocation of replica for fast access to replica upon reading data, thus minimizing job execution time.

In the paper we have developed, implemented and tested a prognostic software system for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of failing components of a commercial grade turbofan engine. The software system was developed in two stages - prognostic stage for predicting engine component's remaining useful life (RUL) and decision-fusion stage for combining the different decisions predicted by the prognostic software. A graphical user interface (GUI) was also developed for testing and ease of operation. Two different prediction approaches were used in the development of the prognostic software - a deterministic and a probabilistic prediction approaches. A nonlinear exponential prediction method was used to develop the deterministic prognostic algorithm and the cloud computation theory was used to develop a probabilistic prediction algorithm. The data used were the estimated efficiency and flow of the engine derived by a diagnostic software from the sensor measurement of temperature and pressure of an engine component. The decision fusion stage was used to fuse all predicted RUL values by the prognostic algorithms to produce a final decision about the most accurate RUL prediction of an engine's failed component. Fuzzy logic inference system was used in the development of the decision-fusion algorithm. The overall performance of the developed prognostic software system was satisfactory and the test results produced accuracy above the ninety percent when the input efficiency and flow data were free of measurement noise. The prediction accuracy of the component's RUL was dropped to about eighty percent when the input data were corrupted with ten percent measurement noise. However, during the fusion stage some of the low RUL prediction accuracy due to noise was regained. In this paper, the development steps along with descripti- ns of the technical approaches used in the development of the prognostics and fusion algorithms are included. Test results are also provided and explained with adequate illustrations along with comparison of the major differences between the two prediction approaches used to develop the prognostics algorithms.","1091-0050;10910050","","10.1109/SECON.2013.6567479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567479","Cloud computation theory;Decision-fusion;Fuzzy logic;Prognostics;Turbine engines","Autoregressive processes;Engines;Equations;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Software;Turbines","aerospace components;aircraft maintenance;computational fluid dynamics;failure analysis;fuzzy reasoning;graphical user interfaces;jet engines;pressure measurement;remaining life assessment;sensor fusion;temperature measurement;turbines","GUI;RUL estimation;RUL prediction accuracy;cloud computation theory;commercial grade turbofan engine;component failure;decision fusion algorithm;deterministic prognostic algorithm;flow data;fuzzy logic inference system;graphical user interface;measurement noise;nonlinear exponential prediction method;online prognostics;pressure measurement;probabilistic prediction algorithm;prognostic software system;remaining useful life estimation;sensor measurement;statistical approach;temperature measurement;turbine engine components","","1","","9","","","4-7 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key idea in our work is to filter clock updates derived from the master-slave message exchange, using only good samples for slave clock updates. The proposed solution is implemented in Network Simulator 2 (NS-2.34). NS-2 test cases are implemented according to the ITU-T G.8261 document covering various network loads and network conditions. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed solution improves the slave accuracy significantly, achieving almost perfect synchronization accuracy in the presence of a wide range of network traffic loads, network congestions, and temporary network outage. Furthermore, when there is a routing path change due to the failure in the network, the solution also maintains high slave clock accuracy with respect to the master clock.","1550-445X;1550445X","","10.1109/AINA.2014.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838641","Clock synchronization;IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP);ITU-T 8261;NS-2;NTP;Packet delay variation (PDV)","Accuracy;Clocks;Delays;Load modeling;Protocols;Synchronization;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;protocols;synchronisation","DAC model;IEEE 1588 PTP protocol;ITU-T G.8261 document;PDV;asymmetric link delays;clock synchronization protocols;delay asymmetry correction model;master-slave synchronization protocols;network conditions;network loads;network simulator 2;precision time protocol;synchronization accuracy;timing packets","","2","","12","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Not only do many undergraduate students lack these ways of thinking, but there is a general misrepresentation of computing in education. Were computing taught as a more serious subject like science and mathematics, public understanding of the complexities of computer systems would increase, enabling those not directly involved with IT make better informed decisions and avoid incidents such as over budget and underperforming systems. We present our exploration into teaching a variety of computing skills, most significantly ""computational thinking"", to secondary-school age children through three very different engagements. First, we discuss Print craft, in which participants learn about computer-aided design and additive manufacturing by designing and building a miniature world from scratch using the popular open-world game Mine craft and 3D printers. Second, we look at how students can get a new perspective on familiar technology with a workshop using App Inventor, a graphical Android programming environment. Finally, we look at an ongoing after school robotics club where participants face a number of challenges of their own making as they design and create a variety of robots using a number of common tools such as Scratch and Arduino.","","","10.1109/iTAG.2014.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990184","STEM;computational thinking;e ducation;games;technology","Computers;Educational institutions;Programming;Robots;Software;Three-dimensional displays","Android (operating system);CAD;computer aided instruction;computer games;computer literacy;educational institutions;printers;robots;teaching","3D printers;AppInventor;Arduino;GCSE;ICT;Teaching;computational thinking;computer-aided design;digital literacy;graphical Android programming environment;misrepresentation;open-world game Minecraft;scratch;software code;were computing","","0","","12","","","16-17 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper is based on empirical research to examine the academic and social uses of mobile telecommunication services by first-year Information Technology (IT) students at Lagos State University, Nigeria (LASU). Students' use of mobile telecommunications services is analyzed using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the theory of planned behaviour. The study identifies challenges that could affect the use of mobile telecommunication services and it also pinpoints some factors that influence the acceptance and usage of mobile phones in education. The analysis enables the understanding of the significance of the variables and their influences on students' perceptions. The significance of these factors as well as limitation of the study was ascertained.

Consequently, D2D-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) promise to provide higher bandwidth through frequency spectrum sharing. However, energy efficient operation of the network becomes a major challenge due to unattended operation of devices. In this study, we propose a solar energy harvesting based model for throughput maximization of an overlay in-band D2D network and consider an energy prediction model for optimal power management. Sum rate maximization problem subject to energy and power constraints is formulated for multiple D2D pairs and maximum achievable throughput is investigated by employing optimal power allocation at transmitters. The proposed model is analysed using real world solar energy harvesting data. The results show that consistently high throughput can be achieved by scheduling the energy arrival duration, while at the same time, energy inefficiency can also handled by optimal power allocation at the devices.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0679-3; POD:978-1-5090-0680-9","10.1109/ISCC.2016.7543879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7543879","","Batteries;Energy harvesting;Internet of things;Receivers;Resource management;Throughput;Transmitters","5G mobile communication;energy harvesting;optimisation;telecommunication power management","5G networks;device-to-device communication;enabled D2D network;energy arrival duration;energy prediction model;frequency spectrum sharing;multitier architecture;optimal power management;overlay in-band D2D network;solar energy harvesting;sum rate maximization;throughput maximization;transmission power management","","","","","","","27-30 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, lack of sufficient bandwidth in active military theaters limit the ability to implement real-time video communication capability, and hence render such clinically beneficial programs undeliverable. Region-of-interest (ROI) video-coding presents a possible solution to this problem. By allocating more bits to the ROI as compared to the rest of the frame (also known as background (BG)), ROI encoding of surgical videos can increase the bandwidth perceived by the telementoring application. In this paper, we introduce a flexible and interactive ROI in a low-complexity, H.264-compliant and diagnostically lossless (DL) fashion to enable remote mentoring of surgical procedures in very low-bandwidth scenarios. Further, subjective evaluations by surgeons indicate that ROI-encoded videos are preferred over the uniformly-encoded videos for the purpose of surgical evaluation and telementoring.","2155-7578;21557578","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415792","","Bandwidth;Bit rate;Encoding;Medical diagnostic imaging;PSNR;Streaming media;Surgery","military communication;military computing;surgery;telemedicine;video coding","H.264 compliant code;ROI encoding;ROI video-coding;ROI-encoded video;active military theater;diagnostically lossless coding;low-bandwidth scenario;military surgical paradigm;region-of-interest video coding;surgical evaluation;surgical telementoring;surgical video;uniformly-encoded video","","4","","17","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The hardware, network protocols and information retrieval techniques for wireless sensor networks are areas of active research. While outdoor monitoring has been done using wireless sensor networks for some time now, little work has been done in indoor environments. This paper presents a novel approach towards a real time system for indoor surveillance of campus-like environments for loud acoustic events such as gunshots. The work proposes the use of low-cost MICAz motes and a scalable networking approach that ensures low-energy consumption, reliable communication and high data rate. The system uses a hierarchical decision making model to categorize loud acoustic signals, localize the event and trigger an alert system in case of critical events like a gunshot.

This relies on stable and accurate SLO enforcement characterized with fast convergence and precisely differentiating service levels. However, highly variable IO characteristics, IO interference among VMs and unstable IO capacity of storage devices can compromise the SLO enforcement by increasing performance error, degrading the SLO compliance and exacerbating the performance fluctuation. To address this challenge, we propose SASLO, an end-to-end VM-oriented control framework that supports stable and accurate SLO enforcement by means of proportional-integral IO control adopted from the classic control theory for each VM. Our extensive evaluation driven by representative benchmarks demonstrates that SASLO is able to achieve near-zero deviation on throughput sharing with lower variability than existing mainstream techniques.

By environment we mean the computational system's broader context, also called the problem world. In this work, we propose a new analysis technique called failure frames, a variation of Jackson's problem frames, to identify and model classes of environmental assumptions whose violation is known from experience to have prevented the requirements from being satisfied. We use instances of failure frames, called failure diagrams, to make explicit in the requirements model the environmental assumptions that contributed to past failures. Developers want to reuse such knowledge of past failures to prevent failures in similar, new systems. We show that failure frames and failure diagrams can capture environmental assumptions that developers need to check in order to prevent recurrence of certain failures in similar application areas. The new failure frame approach that we describe arose from our work in molecular programming of DNA nanosystems. Inaccurate assumptions about the environment are a source of many failures in DNA nanosystems and can be extremely challenging to resolve. We describe the structure of a failure catalog for DNA nanosystems that we have prototyped for use by molecular programmers. We hypothesize that the failure frame approach and catalog can be broadly useful for reducing failure recurrence in other large, distributed applications with autonomous or nondeterministic behavior that must operate in uncertain environments.","","","10.1109/COUFLESS.2015.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7181479","DNA Nanosystems;Environmental Assumptions;Failure Model;Reuse of Failure Knowledge","Catalogs;Context;DNA;Probabilistic logic;Programming;Self-assembly;Software","DNA;biology computing","DNA nanosystems;Jackson problem frames;computational system;distributed applications;environmental assumptions;failure catalog;failure diagrams;failure frames;molecular programming","","0","","23","","","23-23 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some processors use not just a few cores, but tens of cores or even 100 cores. One such many-core microprocessor is the Maestro processor, which is based on Tilera's TILE64 processor. The Maestro chip is a 49-core, general-purpose, radiation-hardened processor designed for space applications. The Maestro processor, unlike the TILE64, has a floating-point coprocessor in each core for improved floating point performance. The Maestro processor runs at up to 350 MHz clock frequency. On the Maestro processor, we implemented an FFT and an image processing application called CRBLASTER and evaluated the performance. The FFT is a well-known and commonly used signal processing kernel. CRBLASTER is a parallel-processing image-analysis application that does cosmic-ray rejection on CCD (charge-coupled device) images using the embarrassingly-parallel L. A. COSMIC algorithm. Both applications were written in C. CRBLASTER uses the high-performance computing industry standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. The achieved performance of the FFT was up to 3,813 MFLOPS, and the speedup compared to single tile was 46.4 using 49 tiles.

In order to avoid storing the crucial user data in more fragile pages, conventional flash management software tends to aggressively discard the high bit-error-rate area in the unit of a block. However, together with the aggressive discarding strategies and the enlarging sizes of pages/blocks of next generation flash memory, the available space of flash devices might encounter a very sharp degradation and therefore result in rapidly-shortened device lifespan. Thus, we advocate the concept of “graceful space degradation” to mitigate this problem by discarding the high bit-error-rate (or worn-out) area in the unit of pages (instead of blocks). To furthermore realize this concept, we are the pioneer to put forward an “uneven space management” to manage flash blocks containing different number of bad pages. Our design especially focuses on placing data with different access behaviors to make the best uses of blocks with different available space so as to ultimately prolong the device lifespan with good access performance. The experiments were conducted based on representative realistic workloads, and the results reveal that the proposed design can extend the device lifetime by at least 2.38 times of that of existent approaches, with very limited performance overheads.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2512902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368127","Bad page;flash memory;flash storage device;graceful space degradation;storage systems","Ash;Degradation;Memory management;Microprocessors;Performance evaluation;Software","error statistics;flash memories;integrated circuit design;manufacturing processes","bit-error-rate variance;cell density;device lifetime;flash blocks;flash chip;flash management software;flash storage devices;graceful space degradation;manufacturing process variance;multilevel-cell programming;next generation flash memory;uneven space management","","","","","","20151229","Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most of this research has gone towards modeling of servers and switches but relatively less amount of work is available on Storage Area Networks (SAN). Storage Area Networks play a very vital role in the data center architecture by using specialized storage hardware to manage data. In this paper, we have extended the Green Cloud simulator for computing the energy consumed by different SAN components. A simulation environment for SAN has been presented using the 'Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling' (DVFS) and 'Dynamic Shutdown' (DNS) techniques. The simulation results obtained through two SAN prototype models shows the energy consumption of SAN components to vary with the network topology and type of technique used in scheduling of the workloads. Our experimental simulations revealed that there is an increasing percentage of energy savings in DNS mode for both topologies for an increasing number of servers.

We propose a generic framework that can be used either for tracking 2D templates in intensity images or for tracking 3D objects in depth images. To overcome problems like partial occlusions, strong illumination changes and motion blur, that notoriously make energy minimization-based tracking methods get trapped in a local minimum, we propose a learning-based method that is robust to all these problems. We use random forests to learn the relation between the parameters that defines the object's motion, and the changes they induce on the image intensities or the point cloud of the template. It follows that, to track the template when it moves, we use the changes on the image intensities or point cloud to predict the parameters of this motion. Our algorithm has an extremely fast tracking performance running at less than 2 ms per frame, and is robust to partial occlusions. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness to strong illumination changes when tracking templates using intensity images, and robustness in tracking 3D objects from arbitrary viewpoints even in the presence of motion blur that causes missing or erroneous data in depth images. Extensive experimental evaluation and comparison to the related approaches strongly demonstrates the benefits of our method.","1063-6919;10636919","","10.1109/CVPR.2014.157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909553","","Lighting;Object tracking;Robustness;Three-dimensional displays;Vectors;Vegetation","minimisation;motion estimation;object tracking","2D template tracking;3D object tracking;chameleon tracking;depth data;depth images;energy minimization;erroneous data;generic framework;illumination changes;image intensity;intensity images;learning-based method;missing data;motion blur;multiforest tracker;object motion;partial occlusions;point cloud;random forests","","5","","21","","","23-28 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The routing protocols designed for Sensor Networks are being divided into three main categories depending on the approaches used. They are Data Centric, Hierarchical and location based. This paper has been concentrated on the performance analysis of the two most prominent data centric protocols, Directed Diffusion and SPIN routing protocol. The performance analysis are examined using NS-2 which is the main network simulator, NAM (Network Animator), TCL (Tool Command Language), AWK (post processing script) and were compared in terms of performance parameters like End-to-End Delay, Throughput, Control Overhead and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR).

As a pragmatic solution, random testing approaches (aka ""monkey testing"") have been suggested for automated random exploration of the system under test via the GUI. This paper presents a versatile framework for monkey GUI testing. The framework provides reusable components and a predefined, generic workflow with extension points for developing custom-built test monkeys.

However, such systems suffer from high defect rates and large parametric variations that can adversely affect system reliability. Hardware duplication is an obvious direction but it incurs significant area overhead that is unacceptable in many scenarios. Memory-based computing (MBC) is a promising alternative to improve overall system reliability when few functional units are defective or unreliable under process-induced or thermal variations. Existing works demonstrated the utility of MBC in single-core based designs. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of MBC in multicore architectures where each core uses a small private cache while a set of cores share a large second-level cache. The private as well as shared caches are used to perform computation on demand using a lookup table. When a functional unit fails, temporarily due to temperature induced variations or permanently, the associated computation is transferred to caches. Experimental results demonstrate that on-demand memory based computing can significantly improve reliability with minor loss in performance.","1548-3746;15483746","","10.1109/MWSCAS.2011.6026672","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6026672","","Analytical models;CMOS integrated circuits;Computational modeling;Heating;Reliability;Semiconductor device modeling;Table lookup","cache storage;embedded systems;integrated circuit reliability;multiprocessing systems;table lookup","embedded memory;gigascale integration;hardware duplication;lookup table;modern electronic systems;multicore architectures;nanoscale devices;on-demand memory-based computing;process-induced;reliability;second-level cache;single-core based designs;small private cache;thermal variations","","3","","19","","","7-10 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In chemical education, the spectrophotometer is used for studying about relationship between the concentration of solution and light absorbance by Beer's law. However, nowadays the spectrophotometer is expensive to purchase many devices for every students learning. The UV-spectrophotometer has many functions which are not necessary in education. To support the chemistry education, we develop the low-cost spectrophotometer for chemistry education by using easy parts and decreasing the unnecessary functions.

Once a linear control system is obtained, a traditional stable pole placement is operated. The control is designed to be implemented using the controlled DC/DC converters that interface the system power sources to the MVDC bus.

Based on our investigations, we have shown that adjusting the S/D doping lateral straggle σL appropriately not only improves SCE but also the program speed and data retention without any need of altering the gate oxide stack. Furthermore, the junction boost leakage current also decreases on reducing σL.

However, a high complexity or a high dimensionality of modern data sets represents a critical obstacle. How do we visualize interesting structures and patterns that may exist in hyper-dimensional data spaces? A better understanding of how we can perceive and interact with multidimensional information poses some deep questions in the field of cognition technology and human-computer interaction. To this effect, we are exploring the use of immersive virtual reality platforms for scientific data visualization, both as software and inexpensive commodity hardware. These potentially powerful and innovative tools for multi-dimensional data visualization can also provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative data visualization and exploration, where scientists can interact with their data and their colleagues in the same visual space.

Therefore, High Level Synthesis (HLS) brings a solution to decrease the design time of dedicated hardware and keep the high abstraction level of software development. In this context we propose a HLS based design flow for Hardware/Software architecture on top of Catapult C Synthesis. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach on the practical implementation example of a full H264/AVC video compression decoder.

However, the majority of studies of ISDM adoption have been widely undertaken to highlight the experience of developed countries, whereas, very little has been done to address ISDM adoption in developing countries. Studies concerned with the status of ISDM usage in many developing countries including the factors that influence and motivate their use, current trends, difficulties, and barriers to adoption are lacking. This paper examines these identified gaps in a developing country, namely Oman. The initial findings reveal that there is limited knowledge and understanding of the concept of ISDM amongst Omani Information Systems (IS) personnel. This is reflected in the quality of the software products being developed and released. However, the analyzed data also reveals a trend whereby a majority of Omani organizations are gradually moving towards increased ISDM adoption and deployment.","","","10.1109/CSCWD.2012.6221837","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6221837","IS;ISDM;Method;Methodology;Oman","Object recognition;Tin","decision making;forecasting theory;information systems;organisational aspects;personnel;social aspects of automation;software quality","AHP;Delphi method;IS personnel;ISDM adoption;Omani information systems personnel;Omani organizations;analytical hierarchy process;developed countries;developing countries;information systems development methodologies;software product quality","","0","","16","","","23-25 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CVSR provides continuous modulation of line reactance by controlling the magnetization in a ferromagnetic core, which occurs by altering the direct current in a winding to bias the magnetization in the core. The deployment of CVSR in commercial power systems requires careful planning to determine if the equipment will meet design objectives and how the equipment responds during power system faults. This paper presents a modeling method that enables simulation of the magnetic interactions within a prototype device simultaneously with the voltages and currents of an externally connected electric circuit. Simulations of the model are compared to finite-element analysis and available experimental results. The simulations are performed on a simple single-phase system under nominal and fault conditions. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method to represent CVSR transient behavior from the perspective of the ac power system.","0885-8977;08858977","","10.1109/TPWRD.2015.2510642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362021","Continuously variable series reactor (CVSR);magnetic amplifier;power system modeling;power-flow control","Inductors;Integrated circuit modeling;Load flow control;Magnetic cores;Power systems;Prototypes;Windings","fission reactor design;fission reactor operation;gyrators","CVSR;continuously variable series reactor;ferromagnetic core;finite-element analysis;gyrator-capacitor approach;meshed electric power networks;power system faults;power-flow control;single-phase system","","","","17","","20151222","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Lab. for Video Technol., Peking Univ., Beijing, China","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2014","23","2","769","784","The exponential growth of surveillance videos presents an unprecedented challenge for high-efficiency surveillance video coding technology. Compared with the existing coding standards that were basically developed for generic videos, surveillance video coding should be designed to make the best use of the special characteristics of surveillance videos (e.g., relative static background). To do so, this paper first conducts two analyses on how to improve the background and foreground prediction efficiencies in surveillance video coding. Following the analysis results, we propose a background-modeling-based adaptive prediction (BMAP) method. In this method, all blocks to be encoded are firstly classified into three categories. Then, according to the category of each block, two novel inter predictions are selectively utilized, namely, the background reference prediction (BRP) that uses the background modeled from the original input frames as the long-term reference and the background difference prediction (BDP) that predicts the current data in the background difference domain. For background blocks, the BRP can effectively improve the prediction efficiency using the higher quality background as the reference; whereas for foreground-background-hybrid blocks, the BDP can provide a better reference after subtracting its background pixels. Experimental results show that the BMAP can achieve at least twice the compression ratio on surveillance videos as AVC (MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding) high profile, yet with a slightly additional encoding complexity. Moreover, for the foreground coding performance, which is crucial to the subjective quality of moving objects in surveillance videos, BMAP also obtains remarkable gains over several state-of-the-art methods.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2013.2294549","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680670","Surveillance video;background difference;background modeling;background reference;block classification","Complexity theory;Decoding;Encoding;Image coding;Object oriented modeling;Surveillance;Video coding","data compression;video coding;video surveillance","AVC;BDP;BMAP method;BRP;MPEG-4 advanced video coding;background difference prediction;background pixels;background prediction efficiency;background reference prediction;background-modeling-based adaptive prediction method;encoding complexity;exponential growth;foreground coding performance;foreground prediction efficiency;foreground-background-hybrid blocks;high-efficiency surveillance video coding technology;surveillance video compression ratio","","13","","46","","20131211","Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The temperature distribution around a microheater was analyzed to generate the thermoresponsive gel and avoid thermal damages to cells. The generation of thermoresponsive gel was conducted using the microheater which was embedded in a probe tip and manipulated by a micromanipulator. The fabrication of a gel block was achieved using the hysteresis character and the fabricated gel block was picked and placed by the probe. Cells were embedded in the gel by controlling the position of microheater to avoid the influence of thermal convection flow.

They provide structural integrity as well as play a vital role in defining the thermal hydraulic behavior of the fuel assembly. The spacer grid design is continuously being improved to achieve better heat transfer characteristics. The studies performed to date include the design optimization and effects of mixing vanes on the thermal hydraulic behavior of fuel assembly. Majority of these studies do not include the effects of springs and dimples of the spacer grid. The present study was performed to analyze the flow behavior and pressure drop across a single coolant channel in the region of spacer grid along with all geometrical details. Detailed analysis of a single coolant channel comprising spacer-grid cell with dimples and spring was done using Ansys-CFX. The mesh independency study was carried out to make a compromise between solution time and accuracy. The problem was solved using K-ε model along with scalable-wall-function option. The Reynolds averaged mass conservation and momentum conservation equations were solved and the pressure and velocity field of flow channel was obtained. The average velocity varies from 2.52m/s to 7.35m/s for Reynolds number variation from 4.0×10<sup>4</sup> to 11.7×10<sup>4</sup>. The cross flow velocities vary from 0.2 to 0.57m/s for these flow conditions. The Euler numbers calculated for these flow conditions were compared to the documented experimental results and were found to be in very good agreement. The analysis results conclude that single cell approach is an accurate and economical approach for predicting the pressure drop across the spacer-grid. The analysis also confirmed the applicability of k-ε model with scalable-wall-function for the prediction of the single phase hydraulic characteristics of spacer-grids.","","","10.1109/IBCAST.2013.6512161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6512161","K-ε;scalable wall function;spacer grids;turbulence model","Assembly;Blades;Computational fluid dynamics;Electronic mail;Fuels;Heating","blades;boundary layer turbulence;channel flow;computational fluid dynamics;fission reactor coolants;fission reactor cooling;fission reactor design;fission reactor fuel;geometry;heat transfer;hydraulic systems;light water reactors;mesh generation;optimisation;pressure vessels","Ansys-CFX;CFD study;Euler numbers;PWR spacer grid;Reynolds averaged mass conservation equations;Reynolds number variation;average velocity;cross flow velocities;design optimization;economical approach;flow behavior;flow channel;flow conditions;geometrical details;heat transfer characteristics;k-ε model;mesh independency study;mixing vane effects;momentum conservation equations;pressure drop;pressure field;pressurized water reactor fuel assembly;scalable-wall-function option;single cell approach;single coolant channel;single phase flow;single phase hydraulic characteristics;solution accuracy;solution time;spacer grid design;spacer grid dimple;spacer grid region;spacer grid spring;spacer-grid cell;structural integrity;thermal hydraulic behavior;velocity 0.2 m/s to 0.57 m/s;velocity 2.52 m/s to 7.35 m/s;velocity field","","1","","6","","","15-19 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially, a transformation method was introduced to represent each DNA sequence with dinucleotide physicochemical property matrix. Then, based on the approximate joint diagonalization theory, an eigenvalue vector was extracted from each DNA sequence, which could be considered as descriptor of the DNA sequence. Moreover, similarity analyses were performed by calculating the pair-wise distances among the obtained eigenvalue vectors. The results show that the proposed approach can capture more sequence information, and can jointly analyze the information contained in all involved multiple sequences, rather than separately, whose effectiveness was demonstrated intuitively by constructing a dendrogram for the 15 beta-globin gene sequences.","","","10.1109/TST.2013.6616518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616518","approximate joint diagonalization;dendrogram;descriptors;physicochemical property;similarityanalysis","DNA;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Proteins;Sequential analysis;Symmetric matrices","","","","0","","","","","Oct. 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

While there has been significant research in policy and VM management, they have so far been treated as disjoint research problems. In this paper, we explore the simultaneous, dynamic VM and policy consolidation, and formulate the Policy-VM Consolidation (PVC) problem, which is shown to be NP-Hard. We then propose Sync, an efficient and synergistic scheme to jointly consolidate network policies and virtual machines. Extensive evaluation results and a testbed implementation of our controller show that policy and VM migration under Sync significantly reduces flow end-to-end delay by nearly 40%, and network-wide communication cost by 50% within few seconds, while adhering strictly to the requirements of network policies.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9953-1; POD:978-1-4673-9954-8","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524354","","Cloud computing;Resource management;Security;Servers;Synchronization;Topology;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computer centres;graph theory;network theory (graphs);virtual machines","PVC;cloud DC;cloud data center;network policy;policy-VM consolidation;synergistic policy;virtual machine consolidation","","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system allows for worldwide near-real-time positioning and data collection of platform terminal transmitters (PTTs). The positioning of the PTTs is achieved by exploiting the Doppler shift in the carrier frequency of the transmitter as recorded by satelliteborne Argos receivers. Until March 15, 2011, a classical nonlinear least squares estimation technique was systematically used to estimate Argos positions. Since then, a second positioning algorithm using a multiple-model Kalman filter was implemented in the operational Argos positioning software. This paper presents this new algorithm and analyzes its performance using a large data set obtained from over 200 mobiles carrying both an Argos transmitter and a GPS receiver used as ground truth. The results show that the new algorithm significantly improves the positioning accuracy, particularly in difficult conditions (for class-A and class-B locations, in the Argos terminology). Moreover, the new algorithm enables the retrieval of a larger number of estimated positions and the systematic estimation of the location error.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2284293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6648418","Argos system;Doppler location;interacting multiple model (IMM) Kalman filter (KF);least squares (LS) estimation;target tracking","Doppler effect;Frequency measurement;Kalman filters;Noise;Satellites;Standards;Vectors","Doppler effect;Global Positioning System;Kalman filters;artificial satellites;data acquisition;least mean squares methods;measurement errors;nonlinear estimation;radio direction-finding;radio receivers;radio transmitters;satellite telemetry","Argos Doppler location;Argos position estimation;Argos transmitter;Doppler shift;GPS receiver;PTT;data collection;multiple model Kalman filtering;nonlinear least square estimation technique;operational Argos positioning software;platform terminal transmitter;satelliteborne Argos receiver;second positioning algorithm;systematic location error estimation;transmitter carrier frequency;worldwide near real-time positioning accuracy","","10","","33","","20131025","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, large-scale battery energy storage systems are still too expensive to be a mass market solution for the renewable energy resources integration. Thus, in order to make battery investment economically viable, the use of second life batteries is investigated in the present work. This paper proposes a method to determine the optimal sizing of a second life battery energy storage system (SLBESS). SLBESS performance is also validated and, as an ultimate step, the power exchanged with the batteries is calculated during one-year operation. The power profile obtained is further used to define the cycling patterns for laboratory testing of second life batteries and to study their ageing evolution when used for the power smoothing renewable integration application.

Unfortunately, many users do not get authorization but transmit files through Bit-Torrent illegally. The piracy problems become a very serious issue because the digital contents can be copied and redistributed easily through P2P network without license owners' authorized. For this reason, digital rights management (DRM) is considered as a general preventive measure to avoid copyright infringement. However, a conventional DRM system implementation on distributed P2P network would be quite difficult.

It is an OASIS standard that is now widely used in a variety of applications, particularly those that require inter-operability between AC systems. The language definition includes a precise grammar, syntax, and semantics, and it is both expressive and verbose. This combination of expressive power and verbosity can lead to difficulty in understanding the language's syntax and semantics for both technical and nontechnical users alike. As a result, reducing the difficulty of editing XACML policies has become an intense area of research. In our own work in this area, we previously showed how to render complex XACML conditions using a non-technical display notation and showed that it is easy to use this notation with interactive plain text editors that do not require any technical coding. Although XACML conditions are expressive and flexible, XACML targets are actually the most commonly used XACML language construct. They have an additional level of complexity, especially in version 3.0, due to the fact that the form and kinds of XACML constructs allowed in targets is much more limited. This paper extends our previous work, showing how the same powerful and flexible interactive editing principles can be applied to targets in order to allow users to use natural logic rather than implementation logic. We extend these principles and fully integrate them into our editing tool, easy XACML. This tool is usable by users with no technical knowledge of XACML, thus making XACML totally transparent to the user, while still retaining all of its functionalities and semantics. Our tool thus allows users to focus on policy logic rather than on details of syntax. As a result, the risk of errors in policies is greatly reduced.","","","10.1109/CTS.2014.6867558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6867558","ABAC;Access control;RBAC;XACML;policy administration point","Access control;Data models;Educational institutions;Medical services;Standards;Syntactics;XML","XML;authorisation;programming language semantics","OASIS standard;XACML target editor;access control policy language;dynamic access control systems;language semantics;language syntax;policy logic","","0","","20","","","19-23 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In 2012, a computer architecture inflection point was declared.This paper reports that the root cause of this phenomenon is the use “virtual circuit” as the basic building block for program-to-program communication. Existing communication protocol implementations do not support the application level data transmission reliability as promised by the virtual circuit concept. In fact, any transient or permanent software/hardware failure in the data packet assembly layers, such as TCP/IP (Fig. 1), can break the application level virtual circuits causing the crash of the entire application [2].","","","10.1109/RWEEK.2015.7287445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7287445","","Computer architecture;Mission critical systems;Multiplexing;Resilience;Software reliability;Switches","application program interfaces;computer architecture;distributed processing;software reliability","TCP/IP;application level data transmission reliability;computer architecture inflection point;data packet assembly layers;distributed API;hardware failure;mission critical distributed applications;performance or reliability scaling dilemma;program-to-program communication;software failure;virtual circuit","","","","26","","","18-20 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extensive circuit-level simulations are performed using this model, and the delay and power performance of TMDFET circuits with different amounts of bending are reported. Simulation results indicate that delay and power tradeoff can be done in TMDFET circuits via bending. Effects from process variation are also evaluated via circuit simulations. Finally, our cross-technology and scaling studies show that while TMDFETs perform better than Si-based transistors in terms of energy-delay product (EDP) at 180-nm and 90-nm technology nodes (the best being 12.7% and 40.7% of that of Si-based transistors, respectively), their EDPs are worse than Si-based transistors (at least 4.9× of that of the best performing Si-based transistor) on the 16-nm technology node.

Traditional supervised band selection methods are often hindered by the problem of lacking enough training samples. To address this problem, we propose a semisupervised band selection method that allows contribution from both labeled and unlabeled hyperspectral pixels. This method first builds a hypergraph model from all hyperspectral samples to measure the similarity among pixels. We show that hypergraph can capture relationship among pixels in both spectral and spatial domain. In the second step, a semisupervised learning method is introduced to propagate class labels to unlabeled samples. Then a linear regression model with group sparsity constraint is used for band selection. Finally, hyperspectral pixels with selected bands are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed method is tested on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its advantages over several other band selection methods.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2443047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152840","Band selection;hypergraph;hyperspectral imaging;image classification","Hyperspectral imaging;Image edge detection;Matrix converters;Sparse matrices;Support vector machines","geophysical image processing;graph theory;image classification;regression analysis;support vector machines","SVM;group sparsity constraint;hypergraph model;hyperspectral image classification;hyperspectral pixels;linear regression model;semisupervised hyperspectral band selection;spectral-spatial hypergraph model;supervised band selection methods;support vector machine classifier;training samples","","2","","33","","20150708","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The problem is formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem considering the total load restored and the time required for restoration. A new encoding scheme is proposed, in which the variables that encode the switch operation are separated into six groups, according to their roles in the faulty system configuration. Employing the idea of defining subspaces of a combinatorial space, those groups are used in order to define subpermutations within which the crossover and mutation operations are performed. In this way, the dimensionality of the search space becomes reduced, allowing a much more efficient search. The proposed encoding scheme also makes a single individual to encode several different solutions, leading to a further reduction of the search space dimensionality. Due to this peculiar feature of the encoding scheme, it becomes convenient to use an adaptation of the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, in which the raw fitness is modified in order to allow the assignment of fitness to individuals that simultaneously encode several different solutions. The proposed algorithm was implemented such that good solutions are delivered within low processing times, of the order of some minutes for large real systems.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2015.2497361","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7317537","Electricity distribution networks;genetic algorithms;load restoration;multiobjective optimization","Decoding;Encoding;Linear programming;Optimization;Power distribution;Switches;Yttrium","Pareto optimisation;combinatorial mathematics;distribution networks;evolutionary computation;power system restoration","biobjective optimization problem;combinatorial space;distribution network restoration;encoding scheme;faulty system configuration;load restoration;power distribution networks;search space dimensionality;strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm;subpermutation-based evolutionary multiobjective algorithm","","","","","","20151103","Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It started with the reliability and performance evaluation of single service pool with multiple services and then employed architecture-based model to obtain the overall reliability/performance model for service composition with multiple service pools. These models were used as the utility function and constraint function to optimize service pool size combination. Two sensitivity-based algorithms were proposed to solve the optimization problem, which assigned more redundant services to those service pools that have higher impact on reliability change and lower impact on performance change.

These steps facilitate the transformation from traditional grids to SGs by integrating a large amount of RE into the grid. Lessons learned from the international experience in this respect are addressed. The accomplished and the proposed regulatory steps to be considered to integrate RE projects into any electricity grid in general and for the Egyptian grid in particular (as an example of developing countries) are explored and evaluated.

Recent trend of deploying middleboxes in cloud as virtualized services further expands potential benefits of middleboxes while avoiding local maintenance burdens. Despite promising, designing outsourced middleboxes still faces several security challenges. First, many middlebox processing services, like intrusion detection, require packet payload inspection, while the ever-increasing adoption of HTTPS limits the function due to the end-to-end encryption. Second, many packet inspection rules used by middleboxes can be proprietary in nature. They may contain sensitive information of enterprises, and thus need strong protection when configuring middleboxes in untrusted outsourced environments. In this paper, we propose a practical system architecture for outsourced middleboxes to perform deep packet inspection over encrypted traffic, without revealing either packet payloads or inspection rules. Our first design is an encrypted high-performance rule filter that takes randomized tokens from packet payloads for encrypted inspection. We then elaborate through carefully tailored techniques how to comprehensively support open-source real rulesets. We formally analyze the security strength. Implementations at Amazon Cloud show that our system introduces roughly 100 millisecond latency in each connection initialization, with individual processing throughput over 3500 packets/second for 500 concurrent connections.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9953-1; POD:978-1-4673-9954-8","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524526","","Cloud computing;Cryptography;Inspection;Middleboxes;Payloads;Systems architecture","business communication;cloud computing;computer network security;cryptography;data privacy","advanced traffic processing;cloud computing;encrypted traffic;enterprise networkS;intrusion detection;middlebox processing service;outsourced middleboxes;packet payload inspection;privacy preserving deep packet inspection;virtualized services","","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This included reliability data for 607 different test populations involving 3980 motors. Exploration of the data revealed that wear-out parameters behaved in accordance with the existing field theory, giving additional confidence to the models.

We usually use several different colors in documents with some intentions, but the quantitative effectiveness of using these colors is not clear. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness from several viewpoints. Further, most of Web documents include images texts and other objects that often work complementary. These types of objects usually painted with colors under a designer's intention. Since a document is a composite object, combinations of colors rather than a single color have more meaning.

As a result, there is no simulation model of bone strength considering bone marrow. While, it has been reported that fat marrow content increased in osteoporotic bone. Whether the fat marrow influences the bone mechanical property is unknown yet. Therefore, the objective of this study was to figure out the contribution of bone marrow fat in bone strength. A finite element model was established by using quantitative computed tomographic (QCT) data from a 63-year-old female's L3 vertebrae. With mechanical load applied on the finite element model, a significant higher maximum stress was observed in the model without bone marrow, compared to the one with fat marrow. The results indicated that bone marrow fat diminish the maximum stress on the trabecular bone and may function as a force buffer in a bone.","2159-3442;21593442","","10.1109/TENCON.2013.6718957","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6718957","bone marrow fat;bone strength;bone stress;finite element analysis","Bones;Computational modeling;Finite element analysis;Load modeling;Solid modeling;Stress","biomechanics;bone;computerised tomography;finite element analysis;medical image processing","L3 vertebrae;QCT;age 63 yr;bone marrow fat;bone mechanical property;bone strength;computed tomographic data;fat marrow content;finite element analysis;mechanical load;osteoporotic bone;trabecular bone","","0","","14","","","22-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of these expenses, alternative computer-based predictive methods have emerged. Predicting a protein's 3-D structure from only its amino acid sequence-also known as ab initio protein structure prediction (PSP)-is computationally demanding because the search space is astronomically large and energy models are extremely complex. Some successes have been achieved in predictive methods but these are limited to small sized proteins (around 100 amino acids); thus, developing efficient algorithms, reducing the search space, and designing effective search guidance heuristics are necessary to study large sized proteins. An on-lattice model can be a better ground for rapidly developing and measuring the performance of a new algorithm, and hence we consider this model for larger proteins (>150 amino acids) to enhance the genetic algorithms (GAs) framework. In this paper, we formulate PSP as a combinatorial optimization problem that uses 3-D face-centered-cubic lattice coordinates to reduce the search space and hydrophobic-polar energy model to guide the search. The whole optimization process is controlled by an enhanced GA framework with four enhanced features: 1) an exhaustive generation approach to diversify the search; 2) a novel hydrophobic core-directed macro-mutation operator to intensify the search; 3) a per-generation duplication elimination strategy to prevent early convergence; and 4) a random-walk technique to recover from stagnation. On a set of standard benchmark proteins, our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We also experimentally show that our algorithm is robust enough to produce very similar results regardless of different parameter settings.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2015.2505317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346476","Combinatorial optimization;HP model;face-centered-cubic (FCC) lattice;genetic algorithms (GAs);macro-mutation;protein structure prediction (PSP);random-walk","Amino acids;FCC;Genetic algorithms;Lattices;Proteins;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays","biology computing;combinatorial mathematics;genetic algorithms;proteins;random processes","3D face-centered-cubic lattice coordinates;ab initio protein structure prediction;amino acid sequence;combinatorial optimization problem;computer-based predictive method;exhaustive generation approach;genetic algorithm;hydrophobic core-directed macromutation operator;hydrophobic-polar energy model;on-lattice model;per-generation duplication elimination;random-walk technique;search guidance heuristics","","","","","","20151203","Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the past, we have designed ferry based scheme for interdomain routing. However, in some scenarios, it is not economical or infeasible to deploy ferries. Thus, in this paper, we present a gateway-based interdomain routing scheme for DTNs. Specifically, our scheme assumes that clusterhead is available in each ad-hoc domain and nodes forward interdomain traffic to gateway nodes which can reach foreign domains. Via simulations and prototyping efforts, we demonstrate that our scheme performs well when different groups partially overlap in their spatial location areas such that candidate nodes that can act as gateway nodes exist.

This allows us to completely decouple the acquisition process from the actual replay of the traces in a simulation context. Then we are able to acquire traces for large application instances without being limited to an execution on a single compute cluster.

The proposed antenna is capable of radiating in the entire UWB range with sufficient gain and desired radiation patterns. Antenna exhibits a notch that comes under the X-band. The antenna proposed here is suitable for entire UWB range application and it avoids the interference from X-band which is used for satellite and military applications.","","","10.1109/NCCSN.2014.7001165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001165","Circular patch antenna;Gain;Inverted T-shaped;Radiation pattern;Ultra-wideband","Antenna radiation patterns;Bandwidth;Conductors;Gain;Ultra wideband antennas","antenna radiation patterns;conductors (electric);microstrip antennas;ultra wideband antennas","C-shaped strip;UWB range application;X band-notch ultrawideband antenna;antenna radiation pattern;compact circular patch antenna;ground plane;inverted T-shape conductor;multiple antenna","","0","","7","","","10-12 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, vulnerabilities and incorrect configuration increase the potential for attacks. Provable verification and simulation tools have been introduced to eliminate configuration conflicts and weaknesses, which can increase system robustness against attacks. Most of these tools require special knowledge in formal methods and precise specification for requirements in special languages, in addition to their excessive need for computing resources. Video games have been utilized by researchers to make educational software more attractive and engaging. Publishing these games for crowdsourcing can also stimulate competition between players and increase the game educational value. In this paper we introduce a game interface, called NetMaze, that represents the network configuration verification problem as a video game and allows for attack analysis. We aim to make the security analysis and hardening usable and accurately achievable, using the power of video games and the wisdom of crowdsourcing. Players can easily discover weaknesses in network configuration and investigate new attack scenarios. In addition, the gameplay scenarios can also be used to analyze and learn attack attribution considering human factors.

In both gaming and sporting VR applications, interaction techniques involve specific gestures such as catching or striking. However, such dynamic gestures are not currently being recognized as elementary task primitives, and have therefore not been investigated as such. In this paper, we propose a framework for the analysis of interaction in dynamic virtual environments (DVEs). This framework is based on three dynamic interaction primitives (DIPs) that are common to many sporting activities: catching, throwing, and striking. For each of these primitives, an original modeling approach is proposed. Furthermore, we introduce and formalize the concept of dynamic virtual fixtures (DVFs). These fixtures aim to assist the user in tasks involving interaction with moving objects or with objects to be set in movement. Two experiments have been carried out to investigate the influence of different DVFs on human performance in the context of ball catching and archery. The results reveal a significant positive effect of the DVFs, and that DVFs could be either classified as “performance-assisted” or “learning-assisted.”","1054-7460;10547460","","10.1162/PRES_a_00116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797356","","","","","","0","","","","","Aug. 2012","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Such a solution can still utilize 3GPP system properties for operators to push offloading policies securely into mobile devices. We discuss existing 3GPP-specified offloading solutions and present three variations of our internet layer traffic offloading implementations, and compare them against 3GPP-specified solutions.

Insuring the software has achieved the intended requirements is the responsibility of the Software Quality team and the Software Test team. The utilization of Timeliner-TLX™ Auto-Procedures for relocating ground operations positions to ISS automated on-board operations has begun the transition that would be required for manned deep space missions with minimal crew requirements. [1] This transition also moves the auto-procedures from the procedure realm into the flight software arena and as such the operational requirements and testing will be more structured and rigorous. The auto-procedures would be required to meet NASA software standards as specified in the Software Safety Standard (NASA-STD-8719), the Software Engineering Requirements (NPR 7150), the Software Assurance Standard (NASA-STD-8739) and also the Human Rating Requirements (NPR-8705). The Autonomous Fluid Transfer System (AFTS) test-bed utilizes the Timeliner-TLX™ Language for development of autonomous command and control software. The Timeliner-TLX™ system has the unique feature of providing the current line of the statement in execution during real-time execution of the software. The feature of execution line number internal reporting unlocks the capability of monitoring the execution autonomously by use of a companion Timeliner-TLX™ sequence as the line number reporting is embedded inside the Timeliner-TLX™ execution engine. This negates I/O processing of this type data as the line number status of executing sequences is built-in as a function reference. This paper will outline the design and capabilities of the AFTS Autonomous Requirements Tracker, which traces and logs SRS requirements as they are being met during real-time executi- n of the targeted system. It is envisioned that real time requirements tracing will greatly assist the movement of auto-procedures to flight software enhancing the software assurance of auto-procedures and also their acceptance as reliable commanders.","1095-323X;1095323X","","10.1109/AERO.2014.6836215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836215","","Encoding;Fluids;Real-time systems;Software systems;Standards;Valves","aerospace computing;formal specification;formal verification;software quality","AFTS;NASA-STD;SDD;SRS;autonomous command and control software;autonomous fluid transfer system;autonomous real time requirements tracing;autonomous requirements tracker;flight software arena;functional software requirements;ground operations positions;human rating requirements;real-time execution;software assurance standard;software detail design;software development;software engineering requirements;software quality team;software requirements specification;software test team;space missions","","0","","1","","","1-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This requires smoother results and typically the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother is used for this purpose. If either of the state transition or plant noise matrices require estimation, a sequence of single time-step smoother cross-covariance matrices, based on the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother formulation, are also required. The modified Bryson-Frazier smoother could be used as the smoother for the Expectation Maximization algorithm, but to estimate the state transition or plant noise matrix, this smoother would first need a method to generate the sequence of single time-step smoother cross-covariance matrices based on the modified Bryson-Frazier formulation. This paper develops an expression for these modified Bryson-Frazier cross-covariance matrices, thus allowing the modified Bryson-Frazier smoother to be substituted for the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother in the Expectation Maximization algorithm. The modified Bryson-Frazier smoother formulation requires inversion only of filter innovation matrices, which are generally much smaller than state error covariance matrices, which allows both greater computational speed and better numerical accuracy due to smaller matrix size. This formulation can be used even when covariance and transition matrices are singular.","0018-9286;00189286","","10.1109/TAC.2013.2270074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544259","Estimation;Kalman filtering;expectation maximization;linear dynamic system;smoothing","","Kalman filters;covariance matrices;expectation-maximisation algorithm;parameter estimation;smoothing methods","Kalman filter parameter matrices estimation;Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother formulation;expectation maximization algorithm;filter innovation matrices;modified Bryson-Frazier smoother cross-covariance;plant noise matrices;plant noise matrix estimation;single time-step smoother cross-covariance matrices;state transition estimation;state transition matrices","","2","","12","","20130619","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

BMTutor is a prototype for visualizing Malay sentences that is combined with sentence checker, sentence correction and word attribute components. The purpose of BMTutor is to check sentence validation, provide sentence correction for invalid sentence used and produce parse tree visualization. The research design involved can be divided into four phases; categorizing sentence and produce repository (Phase 1), developing models and algorithms (Phase 2); development of a prototype (Phase 3); and prototype testing (Phase 4). To date, this system is the only one designed with the functions and characteristics as in BMTutor. There are two BM parsers to check the validity of simple BM sentences had been developed. Both parsers performed three phases in research design, namely 1) the collection of sentence or CFG, 2) develop a prototype, and 3) conduct evaluation. The phases involved are the basic method in developing a prototype. As a result of the lack of models and algorithms have been introduced in both parsers, the model and algorithm development phase is introduced in the design of BMTutor. Output from the development process shows that the prototype is able to provide sentence correction for all 15 invalid sentences and can produce parse tree visualizations for all 20 sentences used for prototype testing.","","","10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7072759","Bahasa Melayu Tutor;Malay sentence checker;Malay sentence correction;Parse tree visualization","Algorithm design and analysis;Conferences;Grammar;Prototypes;Syntactics;Testing;Visualization","data visualisation;intelligent tutoring systems;natural language processing","BMTutor research design;Malay sentence parse tree visualization;check sentence validation;invalid sentence;parse tree visualization;prototype development;prototype testing;sentence checker;sentence correction;word attribute components","","0","","16","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main goal was to obtain relevant unknown parameters such as the inner ring stone thickness of arches for later structural analysis by analytical modelling. Photogrammetric methods were also employed in order to provide the precise external geometry of the bridge.

To investigate, we integrated a system combining an accurate physics-based simulation, robust object recognition and a symbolic planner to achieve realistic prediction of robot actions. A Gazebo simulation was used to reason about and evaluate situations before and during plan execution. The simulation enabled re-planning to take place in advance of actual plan failure. We present a restaurant scenario in which our system prevents plan failure and successfully lets the robot serve a drink on a table cluttered with objects.

Current work relating to the recognition task is divided into two processes: human action extraction and human action classification. This paper starts by identifying the distinct difference between global and local extraction methods. The extraction methods filter out features, such as silhouette, colour, edge, motion and interest point, from images for analysing observed human actions. In terms of human action classification, two key methods known as the k-nearest neighbour approach and hidden Markov model are presented and discussed.

In practice, system performance often varies continually rather than just being functional or failed, especially for a complex system. Profust reliability theory extends the traditional binary state space {0, 1} into a fuzzy state space [0, 1], which is therefore suitable to characterize a gradual physical degradation. Moreover, in profust reliability theory, fuzzy state transitions can also help to describe the health evolution of a component or a system. Accordingly, this paper proposes a profust reliability based PHM approach, where the profust reliability is employed as a health indicator to evaluate the real-time system performance. On the basis of the health estimation, the system remaining useful life (RUL) is further defined, and the mean RUL estimate is predicted by using a degraded Markov model. Finally, an experimental case study of Li-ion batteries is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","0018-9529;00189529","","10.1109/TR.2014.2299111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6714540","Prognostics and health management;health estimation;profust reliability;remaining useful life","Degradation;Estimation;Hidden Markov models;Prognostics and health management;Reliability theory;System performance","fuzzy set theory;lithium;reliability theory;remaining life assessment;secondary cells","Li;PHM technology;Profust reliability based approach;binary state space {0, 1};degraded Markov model;fuzzy state space [0, 1];fuzzy state transitions;health estimation;lithium-ion batteries;mean RUL estimate;prognostics and health management;real-time system performance;system remaining useful life","","9","","44","","20140116","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In both homogeneous and heterogeneous cellular networks, there is a need for scheduling coordination techniques to efficiently distribute the resources and mitigate inter-cell interference. In this paper, we propose a dynamic solution of inter-cell interference coordination performing an optimization of frequency sub-band reuse and transmission power in order to maximize the overall network utility. The proposed framework, based on game theory, permits to dynamically define frequency and transmission power patterns for each cell in the coordinated cluster. Simulation results show significant benefits in average throughput and also cell edge user throughput of 40% and 55% gains when performing the frequency sub-band muting and power control.

In this paper, a two-stage cascade verification system is proposed to minimize the cost of wrong verifications. In the first stage, an improved local mean K-Nearest Neighbor is applied with two reliable parameters to measure the confidence level of the judgment for a testing sample. At the second stage, a multiple expert system is formed with Random Subspace method and the reliability of decisions is evaluated by majority voting. With a testing sample, the first stage classifier will make an evaluation about the confidence level of the verification. If it is reliable enough, the result will be final; otherwise, the sample is rejected by the first stage and passed on to the second for further assessment. In this case, the final result will be the outcome of the second stage when the result has been accepted. Otherwise, this testing sample will be rejected by the whole system. Comparing to a single classifier, the cascade system can reduce the rejection rate with a slight sacrifice of accuracy. The performance of the cascade model is evaluated in terms of the trade-off between the classification accuracy and rejection rate, and the results confirm its effectiveness.","","","10.1109/CISP.2014.7003857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7003857","","Accuracy;Forgery;Reliability;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","decision making;expert systems;handwriting recognition;image classification;random processes","cascade classifier ensemble;classification accuracy;decision reliability;financial transactions;improved local mean K-nearest neighbor;legal transactions;multiple expert system;offline signature verification;random subspace method;rejection rate;two-stage cascade verification system","","0","","13","","","14-16 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To evaluate its performance, its capacity limits are of particular importance. Therefore, this paper analyzes its constellation-constrained capacities for cases where the channel state information (CSI) is unknown at the transmitter and perfectly known at the receiver. In frequency selective channels, GFDM may provide advantage over the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme. In order to achieve near-capacity performance, the interaction of data symbols in time and frequency combined with multiple antennas (MIMO) challenges the design of GFDM receivers. This paper, therefore, applies expectation propagation (EP) for systematic receiver design. It is shown that the resulting iterative MIMO-GFDM receiver with affordable complexity can approach optimum decoding performance and outperform MIMO-OFDM in a rich multipath environment. Simulations are also used to illustrate the impact of channel delay spread on the constellation-constrained capacities and on the performance of the novel receiver algorithm.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2015.2482479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7279195","5G;5G, non-orthogonal waveforms;GFDM;MIMO;expectation propagation;mutual information;nonorthogonal waveforms","Complexity theory;Iterative decoding;MIMO;Modulation;OFDM;Receivers;Wireless communication","MIMO communication;OFDM modulation;antenna arrays;iterative decoding;mobile computing;radio receivers;signal detection;wireless channels","CSI;GFDM receivers;MIMO-GFDM signals;OFDM;channel state information;constellation-constrained capacities;data symbols interaction;expectation propagation;frequency selective channels;future mobile networks;generalized frequency division multiplexing;iterative MIMO-GFDM receiver;multiple antennas;near-capacity performance;near-optimum detection;nonorthogonal waveform;optimum decoding performance;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing scheme;systematic receiver design","","","","30","","20150928","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The microwave data were acquired over a natural Virginia Pine forest in Maryland by a ground-based microwave active/passive instrument system in 2008/2009. Ground measurements of the tree biophysical parameters and forest floor characteristics were obtained during the field campaign. The test site consisted of medium-sized evergreen conifers with an average height of 12 m and average diameters at breast height of 12.6 cm. The site is a typical pine forest site in that there is a surface layer of loose debris/needles and an organic transition layer above the mineral soil. In an effort to characterize and model the impact of the surface litter layer, an experiment was conducted on a day with wet soil conditions, which involved removal of the surface litter layer from one half of the test site while keeping the other half undisturbed. The observations showed detectable decrease in emissivity for both polarizations after the surface litter layer was removed. A first-order radiative transfer model of the forest stands including the multilayer nature of the forest floor in conjunction with the ground truth data are used to compute forest emission. The model calculations reproduced the major features of the experimental data over the entire duration, which included the effects of surface litter and ground moisture content on overall emission.

In this work, we show that, Vaidya et al.'s scheme suffers from the risk of forgery attacks and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. To cope with them, we propose a new solution which is quite adequate for power and resource constrained sensor networks. The proposed scheme not only retains all the advantages in Vaidya et al.'s scheme but also protects against DoS and forgery attacks.

These registers fall into two categories, model specific registers (MSRs) and configuration space registers (CSRs). Many of these registers, such as those supported by PAPI, help the high-performance computing (HPC) community analyze their program in order to maximize performance and use resources more efficiently. However, there are many MSRs and CSRs which are not supported by existing performance tools. The MSR kernel module provides access to all MSRs, but requires the user to be root. Users will typically want to access a handful of MSRs sequentially, but we found that the existing MSR module has far too much overhead. Just like MSRs, users need elevated privileges to access CSRs with utilities such as lspci. Simply allowing users to access all of the registers is out of the question because of the security risks involved. Furthermore, using these registers requires detailed knowledge of the architectural changes in addition to the manufacturer's proprietary ways of encoding the data. In this paper, we will describe a group of utilities developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to address these problems. Our Libmsr API solves the usability issues by providing a simplified interface to common tasks. The companion kernel module, MSR-SAFE, allows white listing MSRs for userspace access, plus provides an optimized way to access MSRs in batches. Our CSR-SAFE kernel module is a first of its kind utility to white list sections of the PCI configuration space, where CSRs reside, for userspace access. We demonstrate the abilities of Libmsr and MSR-SAFE by using the utilities to set various power limits on the NAS parallel benchmark MG. Experiments analyzing our optimizations show a maximum speedup of 26X, and approximately 2-8X on average for typical batches versus the stock MSR kernel module. O- r utilities currently support most modern Intel processors.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3682-0; POD:978-1-5090-3683-7","10.1109/IPDPSW.2016.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7529995","Model Specific Registers;PCI Configuration Registers;Performance;Power;RAPL;Scalability","Hardware;Kernel;Program processors;Radiation detectors;Registers;Security;Sockets","parallel processing;power aware computing","CSR-SAFE kernel module;HPC community;Intel processors;MSR kernel module;MSR-SAFE;NAS parallel benchmark MG;PAPI;PCI configuration space;best practices;configuration space registers;high performance computing;model specific registers;power budgeting;scalable power control;scalable power measurement;security risks;thermal monitoring;usability;user space access","","","","","","","23-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, in the near future, multiple heterogeneous and unlicensed ad hoc networks will coexist within the same geographical area over shared TV White Space. Although heterogeneity and coexistence are not unique to TV White Space scenarios, their distinctive characteristics pose new and challenging issues. In this paper, the problem of the coexistence interference among multiple heterogeneous and secondary ad hoc networks in absence of secondary cooperation is addressed. Specifically, the optimal coexistence strategy, i.e., the coexistence strategy maximizing the expected throughput in presence of coexistence interference, is designed. More in detail, at first, an analytical framework is developed to model the channel selection process for an arbitrary SN as a decision process, where the reward models the data rate achievable on a channel and the cost models the communication overhead for assessing the coexistence interference. Then, we derive the closed-form expression of the expected throughput, which allows us to determine the optimal coexistence strategy.

The sensor nodes are powered by solar energy harvester instead of alkaline battery. This design eliminates the need to use alkaline batteries to nodes which require frequent replacement from time to time. The Energy harvesting system consists of two key components viz. an energy harvesting unit and an energy storage module. The energy harvesting module consists of an adequate number of solar cells connected in series and parallel to scavenge energy while the energy storage module consists of combination of a set of Ultracapacitors connected along with alkaline batteries which could be used as a back-up energy source.

It allows predictions about essential droplet characteristics, such as droplet volume and flight velocity, for a given set of droplet generator (DG) dimensions, material and fluid properties and a predetermined electrical excitation. This enables the targeted adaption of the droplet generator's design to varying application requirements, such as different fluid properties, with a minimum number of design iterations. The model is implemented by transferring the resulting differential equations to the Matlab/SIMULINK™ simulation environment. It is verified by comparing its output with an extensive empirical dataset which is obtained by fabricating a selection of droplet generators with different geometrical dimensions and testing them with several different fluids. Despite the fact that the model is based on strongly simplified physical relationships, it is able to accurately predict the minimum excitation voltage needed for droplet generation as well as the droplet velocity. However, the volume of the ejected droplets could not be predicted with satisfactory results, which is attributed to the limited accuracy of the nozzle submodel.","","","10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090730","","Computational modeling;Fluids;Generators;Mathematical model;Piezoelectric materials;Pumps;US Department of Defense","differential equations;drops;fluid dynamics;mathematics computing;nozzles;piezoelectric devices;printing machinery","Matlab;Simulink;differential equations;fluid mechanical relationships;nozzles;piezoelectric bend-mode droplet generator;piezoelectric drop-on-demand printhead;predetermined electrical excitation","","0","","14","","","5-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nowadays, the increasing demands for community detection in large-scale social networks necessitate the use of distributed and scalable methods to detect communities in an effective and efficient manner. Label propagation algorithm (LPA), whose time complexity is O (m) on a network with m edges, is a near linear time algorithm to detect community effectively. Besides, owing to having good scalability, the parallel version of LPA (DLPA) is suitable for community detection in large-scale social networks. However, DLPA synchronously updates the vertices labels, which usually brings about label oscillations and results in low quality of partitioning. In this paper, we analyze the drawbacks of DLPA and propose a novel method C-DLPA, which combines DLPA with the notion of maximal cliques and at the same time utilizes a new updating mechanism that updating each node' label by probability of its adjacent nodes, to make final partitioning become more accurate and to avoid oscillations effectively. The experimental results show that C-DLPA has better performance is not only low time cost by as much to avoid oscillations but its community detection accuracy compared with DLPA.","","","10.1109/SMC.2015.239","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7379371","community detection;distributed algorithm;label propagation algorithm;maximal cliques;synchronous","Algorithm design and analysis;Image edge detection;Oscillators;Partitioning algorithms;Social network services;Time complexity;Transforms","computational complexity;network theory (graphs);probability;social networking (online)","C-DLPA;adjacent node probability;highly cohesive vertex subset detection;label oscillation;label propagation algorithm;large-scale social network;maximal cliques;near linear time algorithm;network edges;node label updating mechanism;stable distributed community detection algorithm;time complexity","","","","11","","","9-12 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some important goals while developing a Visual Cryptography scheme is to have (i)optimum number of shares, (ii)good quality of reconstructed image and (iii)keeping the size of share small. This paper aims to provide a comparative study of various Visual Cryptographic schemes based on pixel expansion, no of shares, size and quality of reconstructed image, etc and some real-life applications of visual cryptography. A new authentication system has been proposed which uses the technique of visual cryptography to improve the security level of existing schemes. The application of the system in financial domain is discussed.","","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141416","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141416","contrast;pixel expansion;share;stacking;visual cryptography schemes (VCS)","Authentication;Encryption;Image color analysis;Image reconstruction;Visualization","cryptography;image reconstruction;image resolution","authentication system;data security;encryption techniques;human visual system;image reconstruction;pixel expansion;security level improvement;visual cryptography scheme","","2","","20","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The force-displacement curves for the type 1 interface show a clear force plateau indicating steady delamination propagation along the interface. The interface properties for this measurement can be calculated analytically from the steady-state part of the curve. Transient calculations on a 2D plane strain finite element model including cohesive zone elements show that the effect of intrinsic thermal stresses due to processing on the resulting force-displacement curve is apparent. The force-displacement curves for the type 2 samples do not show a clear force plateau. The deformation of the samples clearly shows this can be attributed to non-linear effects that are not considered in the analytical stead-state solution. The influence of the main contributors to nonlinear behavior, such as plasticity, large deformations, and contact at the supports is investigated.

In this study, we present a new visual stimuli-driven, non-volitional brain responses based methodological framework towards individual identification. The non-volitional mechanism provides an even more secure way in which the individuals are not aware of security credentials and thus can not manipulate their brain activities. Given the intercorrelated structure of brain functional areas, instead of making the identification decision relying on any single EEG channel, we propose a new identification approach based on the decision-level fusion of multichannel EEG signals, using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network and its improved versions. Specifically, the identification decision is determined according to the identification patterns reflected from multiple EEG channels over the desired brain functional region. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods based on four different visual stimuli and four independent EEG channels. Experimental results show that, the proposed fusion technique can significantly improve the identification accuracy, compared to the conventional single channel based solution. For RBF network, the accuracy of identifying 37 subjects could reach over 70%, which is better than the average accuracy of about 55% achieved through individual channels. For the improved RBF networks, the frequency-based decision making could reach the accuracy of 90%, while the probability-based method could reach over 91%.

The proposed phase-alignment ADDCC (PA-ADDCC) not only achieves the desired output/input phase alignment, but also maintains the output duty cycle at 50% with a short locking time. In addition, the proposed high-resolution ADDCC (HR-ADDCC) without a half-cycle delay line can improve the delay resolution and mitigate the delay mismatch problem in a nanometer CMOS process.

In such positions, people will expect them to be experts on their area of specialty. Not only will robots need to be experts, but they will also need to communicate their expertise effectively in order to raise trust and compliance with the information that they provide. This paper draws upon literature in psychology and linguistics to examine cues in speech that would help robots not only to provide expert knowledge, but also to deliver this knowledge effectively. To test the effectiveness of these cues, we conducted an experiment in which participants created a plan to tour a fictional city based on suggestions by two robots. We manipulated the landmark descriptions along two dimensions of expertise: practical knowledge and rhetorical ability. We then measured which locations the participants chose to include in the tour based on their descriptions.

Inkjet-printed interconnections on top of the battery are proposed in order to reduce the size and costs of wireless sensor network devices that require the use of Li-ion batteries. The reliability of such interconnections under high-humidity and elevated-temperature conditions is characterized in terms of electrical and adhesion properties; the micro- and macrostructures of the ink are observed in detail. Two silver inks are used to print the interconnections. The resistivity values of printed structures are in the range of 8.6-47.6 μΩ·cm, and all of them pass the reliability tests. The adhesion characteristics are good for Ink A; however, Ink B presents failures under high-humidity conditions. For a good adhesion, a plasma treatment should be performed prior to printing. The electrical performance of the interconnections is not affected by high-humidity and high-temperature conditions. Furthermore, there is no indication of silver migration. It is recommended that the curing temperature of the ink is kept low (<; 155°C) in order to avoid cracks in the ink structure and damages to the battery's packaging foil. The interconnections should be printed before filling the battery to avoid the decomposition of the electrolyte which happens at 80 °C.","1530-4388;15304388","","10.1109/TDMR.2012.2223759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6328261","Adhesion;Li-ion battery;inkjet printing;nanoparticle inks;reliability;resistivity;system in package (SiP)","Adhesives;Batteries;Ethanol;Ink;Plasmas;Substrates;Surface treatment","adhesion;ink jet printing;interconnections;lithium;reliability;secondary cells;system-in-package","Li;adhesion property;battery packaging foil;cracks;electrical performance;electrolyte decomposition;elevated-temperature conditions;fabrication process;foil-type lithium-ion batteries;high-humidity conditions;ink macrostructures;ink microstructures;plasma treatment;power source;reliability tests;reliable inkjet-printed interconnections;shapeable rechargeable lithium-ion batteries;system-in-package devices;temperature 80 degC;wireless sensor network devices","","2","","19","","20121010","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As such, a reference model is required to achieve this task in an integrated and consistent manner. The reference model for agro-geoinformation standards defined aim, emphasis, groups of standards and their relation. Using methods of system engineering and conceptual schema, this paper developed and brought forward a reference model for agro-geoinformation standards. The reference model consists of three levels - the base standard level, the general standard level, the profile and application standard level. The general standard consists of five groups including guidance standards, data or product standards, management standards, application system development standards and information service standards. The paper mainly set forth the standard composition and essentials of five groups. It put forward important principles and methods for building specific agricultural information standard profiles and application standards based on the base standard and the general standard.

The practice of computing across two or more data centers separated by the Internet is growing in popularity due to an explosion in scalable computing demands. However, one of the major challenges that faces the cloud computing is how to secure and protect the data and processes the data of the user. The security of the cloud computing environment is a new research area requiring further development by both the academic and industrial research associations. While cloud-bursting is addressing this process of scaling up and down across data centers. To provide secure and reliable services in cloud computing environment is an important issue. One of the security issues is how to reduce the impact of denial-of-service (DoS) attack or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)in this environment. In this paper we survey several aspects of cloud computing and the security concerns and proposed a novel approach that is Cloud Bursting Brokerage and Aggregation (CBBA). In this approach we consider three clouds for bursting and aggregation operation. We also used secure sharing mechanism so that the cloud resources are shared among different cloud environment.","","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141288","CBBA;Cloud Computing;Cloud Model;Security Model","Cloud computing;Companies;Computers;Electronic mail;Security;Servers","cloud computing;computer centres;computer network security","academic research;cloud bursting brokerage and aggregation;cloud computing;cloud model based security;data centers;distributed denial of service attack;industrial research;information and communication technology;market development;renal environment;services reliable","","7","","19","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a separate trial, the companies also achieved data throughput that exceeded 10 Gb/s at a distance of approximately 70 m from the base station. Moreover, the tests reached data transmissions exceeding 9 Gb/s at a distance of approximately 120 m from the base station. The trials used Ericsson 5G radio prototypes with multiple user, multiple-input, multiple-output (MU-MIMO) and massive MIMO to increase downlink throughput. Ericsson 5G radio prototypes use MU-MIMO to transmit data to several user devices using the same time and frequency resources, thus increasing the system's spectral efficiency. Massive MIMO - the combination of MIMO and beamforming with a large number of antenna elements-improves both throughput and energy efficiency. With beam tracking, Ericsson 5G radio prototypes track the position and movements of a given device and point one or more beams in the best direction for that device in real time, to ensure consistently reliable connections. These beams can originate from multiple transmission points. Each compact 5G radio prototype, the size of a piece of carry-on luggage, supports the equivalent of 40 long-term evolution (LTE) carriers.","1556-6072;15566072","","10.1109/MVT.2016.2544239","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474037","","5G mobile communication;Base stations;Downlink;Energy efficiency;Long Term Evolution;MIMO;Throughput","5G mobile communication;MIMO communication;array signal processing;radio equipment","5G technologies;Ericsson 5G radio prototypes;LTE carriers;antenna elements;beamforming;data transmissions;downlink bitrate;fifth generation technologies;fifth-generation technologies trials;frequency resources;mobile devices;mobile radio;multiple user multiple-input multiple-output systems;outdoor environment","","","","","","","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper implements and evaluates the performance of a low-energy GPS prototype. The main difference is that a traditional GPS needs to sample signals transmitted by satellites for 30 seconds to estimate its position. Our prototype reduces this time by three orders of magnitude and it can compute positions from only 2 milliseconds of data. We present a new algorithm that increases robustness by filtering on estimated residuals instead of using an altitude database. In addition, we show that our new algorithm works with both fixed and moving targets. The solution consists of (1) a portable device that samples the GPS signal and (2) a server that utilizes Doppler navigation and Coarse Time Navigation to estimate positions. We performed tests in a wide variety of environments and situations. These tests show that our prototype provides a median positioning error of roughly 40 meters even when the GPS receiver is moving at 80 kilometres per hour.","","Electronic:978-0-9964-5274-8; POD:978-1-5090-2012-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528057","","Clocks;Global Positioning System;Receivers;Satellite broadcasting;Satellites;Servers","Global Positioning System;filtering theory;radio receivers;target tracking;telecommunication power management","Doppler navigation;GPS receivers;GPS signal;Global Positioning System;altitude database;coarse time navigation;fixed targets;low-energy GPS prototype;low-energy positioning;median positioning error;moving targets;multistep algorithm;satellites","","","","","","","5-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a near-field terahertz beam waveguide feed cassegrain quasi-optical mono-pulse antenna test system is proposed according to the characteristics of high frequency of terahertz and the test difficulty of terahertz antenna. The and-differential comparator and feed system of our terahertz mono-pulse antenna system are in the structure of quasi-optical, which can reduces the energy transmission loss, simple structure, easy processing relative to waveguide structure when the electromagnetic wave propagates in space in beam bunching. The system is fixed on the quasi-optical table, and can test the performance of the antenna effectively. The system also realizes real time display and the automatic formatted storage. It is proved to run stably, have high reliability and meet the demand for actual applications.","","","10.1109/ICEMI.2015.7494329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7494329","beam waveguide;electro-motion turntable;quasi-optical mono-pulse antenna;terahertz wave","Biographies;Presses;Software","","","","","","10","","","16-18 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transport parameters of the macroscopic models are taken from homogeneous subband MC simulations, thereby implicitly taking surface roughness and quantization effects into account. Our results demonstrate that the drift-diffusion (DD) model predicts accurate drain currents down to channel lengths of about 40 nm but fails to predict the transit frequency below 80 nm. The energy-transport (ET) model, on the other hand, gives good drain currents and transit frequencies down to 80 nm, whereas below 80 nm, the error rapidly increases. The six moments model follows the results of MC simulations down to 30 nm and outperforms the DD and the ET models.","0018-9383;00189383","","10.1109/TED.2011.2181177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6140555","Drift-diffusion (DD) model;energy-transport (ET) model;higher order transport models;quantization;six moments (SM) model;subband Monte Carlo (SMC);surface roughness scattering","Computational modeling;Equations;Heating;MOSFETs;Mathematical model;Scattering;Surface roughness","MOSFET;Monte Carlo methods;nanoelectronics;semiconductor device models;surface roughness;transport processes","decananometer MOSFET;drain current;drift diffusion model;energy transport model;macroscopic transport model;multisubband Monte Carlo device simulation;quantization effect;surface roughness;ultra thin body double gate realization","","2","","44","","20120125","March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Refactoring existing code to use these new features enables explicit but unobtrusive parallelism and makes the code more succinct. However, refactoring is tedious (it requires changing many lines of code) and error-prone (the programmer must reason about the control-flow, data-flow, and side-effects). Fortunately, these refactorings can be automated. We present LambdaFicator, a tool which automates two refactorings. The first refactoring converts anonymous inner classes to lambda expressions. The second refactoring converts for loops that iterate over Collections to functional operations that use lambda expressions. In 9 open-source projects we have applied these two refactorings 1263 and 1595 times, respectively. The results show that LambdaFicator is useful.

Big Data plays a major role in this new change. One of the biggest challenges that the healthcare industry faces while it steps up digitization is the sheer size of the data, speed of generation of this data and complexity arising out of multiple & non-standard formats. Patient data residing in disparate systems is a roadblock to having the right information at the right time. Clinical Decision Support systems need a single view of the patient for making better diagnosis and treatments. Patient identification and matching is a critical challenge in interfacing to the Electronic Health Record (EHR). Different documents and results from various disparate systems like laboratory, pharmacy, claims systems etc. need to be linked to the correct patient record. At this point when healthcare organizations share patient information internally as well as externally, patient records from numerous disparate databases should be connected effectively to guarantee that the decisions made by the clinicians are based on correct patient records and minimizing duplicate information and overheads. This arises the need of improving patient matching for better decision support using single patient view. This paper attempts to study the problem of matching patient records from disparate systems and proposes a solution by using Big Data Analytic techniques like Fuzzy Matching algorithms & MapReduce for better clinical decision support. The main benefits of the proposed system are scalability, cost-effectiveness, flexibility of using any fuzzy algorithm and handling of any data source.","","","10.1109/ICRITO.2015.7359269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359269","Big Data Analytics;Clinical Decision Support System;Fuzzy matching;Levenshtein Algorithm;MapReduce;Patient Matching","Big data;Distributed databases;Industries;Medical services;Organizations;Scalability","Big Data;decision making;decision support systems;electronic health records;fuzzy set theory;health care;patient diagnosis;patient treatment;pattern matching","EHR;big data analytic techniques;clinical decision support system;data explosion;data generation;data source handling;decision making;duplicate information minimization;electronic health record;fuzzy matching algorithms & MapReduce;healthcare industry digitization;healthcare organizations;nonstandard format data;patient data matching;patient diagnosis;patient identification;patient treatments","","2","","21","","","2-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While several dynamic binary analysis tools and frameworks have been proposed, all suffer from one or more of: prohibitive performance degradation, a semantic gap between the analysis code and the program being analyzed, architecture/OS specificity, being user-mode only, and lacking APIs. We present DECAF, a virtual machine based, multi-target, whole-system dynamic binary analysis framework built on top of QEMU. DECAF provides Just-In-Time Virtual Machine Introspection and a plugin architecture with a simple-to-use event-driven programming interface. DECAF implements a new instruction-level taint tracking engine at bit granularity, which exercises fine control over the QEMU TCG (Tiny Code Generator) intermediate representation to accomplish on-the-fly optimizations while ensuring that the taint propagation is sound and highly precise. We perform a formal analysis of DECAF’s taint propagation rules to verify that most instructions introduce neither false positives nor false negatives. We also present 3 platform-neutral plugins - Instruction Tracer, Keylogger Detector, and API Tracer, to demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of DECAF in writing cross-platform and system-wide analysis tools. Implementation of DECAF consists of 9550 lines of C++ code and 10270 lines of C code and we evaluate DECAF using CPU2006 SPEC benchmarks and show average overhead of 605% for system wide tainting and 12% for VMI.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2016.2589242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506264","Dynamic binary analysis;dynamic taint analysis;virtual machine introspection","Computer architecture;Context;Instruments;Kernel;Registers;Semantics;Virtual machining","","","","","","","","20160707","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The simulated PMU extracted phasor information by using conventional Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT). Studies of the damping performance under various PMU reporting rate were also conducted. From simulated small-signal disturbances and faults, it was found that the integration of PMU could achieve similar damping performance as those of analogue inputs. However, the damping performances using the simulated PMU were also observed to be less desirable than using an ideal PMU. The cause is the ideal PMU does not consider estimation imperfections such as leakage effects and hardware limitations of A/D conversion. This paper concluded that using PMU measurements as feedback signals is suitable damping oscillations. Detailed PMU model is recommended to be considered during the formulation and validation of a control strategy.","","","10.1109/NAPS.2015.7335198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7335198","DFT;PMU reporting rate;damping oscillation","Damping;Discrete Fourier transforms;Estimation;Mathematical model;Oscillators;Phasor measurement units;Synchronous generators","damping;discrete Fourier transforms;feedback;phasor measurement;power system faults","DFT;PMU;damping electromechanical oscillation;damping oscillation analysis;discrete Fourier transformation;discrete control signal;discrete feedback signal;phasor measurement unit;small-signal disturbance","","","","15","","","4-6 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Contrary to existing approaches the arising procedure does not require an (often nontrivial) blind identification step. Nonetheless, insightful connections with the dynamics of the generating systems can be drawn under specific modeling assumptions. The method is illustrated on both synthetic examples as well as on a brain decoding task where the direction, either left of right, towards where the subject modulates attention is predicted from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. Kernel functions for unstructured data do not leverage the underlying dynamics of multichannel signals.

Eng., Univ. of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus","IEEE Sensors Journal","","2014","14","8","2765","2772","This paper presents a low cost and holistic approach to the water quality monitoring problem for drinking water distribution systems as well as for consumer sites. Our approach is based on the development of low cost sensor nodes for real time and in-pipe monitoring and assessment of water quality on the fly. The main sensor node consists of several in-pipe electrochemical and optical sensors and emphasis is given on low cost, lightweight implementation, and reliable long time operation. Such implementation is suitable for large scale deployments enabling a sensor network approach for providing spatiotemporally rich data to water consumers, water companies, and authorities. Extensive literature and market research are performed to identify low cost sensors that can reliably monitor several parameters, which can be used to infer the water quality. Based on selected parameters, a sensor array is developed along with several microsystems for analog signal conditioning, processing, logging, and remote presentation of data. Finally, algorithms for fusing online multisensor measurements at local level are developed to assess the water contamination risk. Experiments are performed to evaluate and validate these algorithms on intentional contamination events of various concentrations of escherichia coli bacteria and heavy metals (arsenic). Experimental results indicate that this inexpensive system is capable of detecting these high impact contaminants at fairly low concentrations. The results demonstrate that this system satisfies the online, in-pipe, low deployment-operation cost, and good detection accuracy criteria of an ideal early warning system.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2014.2316414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786370","Arsenic & bacteria contamination detection;flat surface sensors;multi-sensor system;sensor networks;turbidity sensor;water quality monitoring","Contamination;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Water pollution","alarm systems;contamination;data loggers;data structures;electrochemical sensors;market research;microsensors;optical sensors;pipes;sensor arrays;sensor fusion;signal conditioning circuits;water quality","analog signal conditioning;arsenic;contamination detection;data logging;data processing;data remote presentation;drinking water distribution system;early warning system;escherichia coli bacteria;fusing online multisensor measurement;heavy metal;in-pipe electrochemical sensor;in-pipe monitoring;large scale deployment;market research;microsystem;optical sensor;sensor array;water company;water consumer;water quality assessment;water quality monitoring","","10","","43","","20140410","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Next, a system control board was designed to maintain robust operation so that users could connect with each other anytime. In the system, we also implemented a reminiscence based therapy application to prevent the progression of dementia. The application can show old photos to dementia patients during a typical video chat. From the caregivers' point of view, our system is also an important form of assistance for repeating announcements and instructions to dementia patients with poor memory.

In the ISOCS method, the user needs to input the geometry related parameters such as: the source dimensions, matrix composition and density, along with the source-to-detector distance. In many applications, the source dimensions, the matrix material and density may not be well known. Under such circumstances, the efficiencies may not be very accurate since the modeled source geometry may not be very representative of the measured geometry. CANBERRA developed an efficiency optimization software known as “Advanced ISOCS” that varies the not well known parameters within user specified intervals and determines the optimal efficiency shape and magnitude based on available benchmarks in the measured spectra. The benchmarks could be results from isotopic codes such as MGAU, MGA, IGA, or FRAM, activities from multi-line nuclides, and multiple counts of the same item taken in different geometries (from the side, bottom, top etc). The efficiency optimization is carried out using either a random search based on standard probability distributions, or using numerical techniques that carry out a more directed (referred to as “smart” in this paper) search. Measurements were carried out using representative source geometries and radionuclide distributions. The radionuclide activities were determined using the optimum efficiency and compared against the true activities. The “Advanced ISOCS” method has many applications among which are: Safeguards, Decommissioning and Decontamination, Non-Destructive Assay systems and Nuclear reactor outages maintenance.","","","10.1109/ANIMMA.2011.6172913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172913","","Benchmark testing;Calibration;Detectors;Geometry;Optimization methods;Software","calibration;germanium radiation detectors;high energy physics instrumentation computing;optimisation;probability;radioactivity measurement;random processes","CANBERRA;FRAM code;IGA code;MGA code;MGAU code;advanced ISOCS method;geometry related parameters;high purity germanium detector efficiencies;in situ object counting software;mathematical efficiency calibration;mathematical method;matrix composition;matrix density;matrix material;nondestructive assay systems;nuclear reactor decommissioning;nuclear reactor decontamination;nuclear reactor outage maintenance;numerical techniques;optimal efficiency magnitude;optimal efficiency shape;optimization efficiency;radionuclide activities;radionuclide distributions;random search method;safeguard analysis;smart optimization method;source geometry model;source-to- detector distance;standard probability distributions;uncertain source geometries","","1","","11","","","6-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Greater effects of summer learning loss are generally associated with lower income families. Additionally, minorities and women remain underrepresented in the STEM Fields. Based on this information and desires to engage with community in effective and scholarly ways, founders of the Lafayette College Summer camp established a summer STEM education venue for young children in 2011. Recognizing that inclusion of the Arts added interest to our general theme and education modules, and served to enhance our education messaging, STEM Camp became STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, ARTS, and Math) Camp in 2014. An additional highlight of this camp is the fact that the leadership, ideas, design and organization of all modules is a production led by two undergraduates, one student majoring in Arts-Humanities and a second majoring Science-Engineering. A group of volunteers made up of faculty, local K12 teachers, college and high school students, and community members, support all camp activities throughout the four-day event.

Although localization is adopted in some web designs, more insights is needed on culture-centered design. This study focuses on understanding the Islamic culture and interface design. As Muslims form a large proportion of the world population, and the percentage of Internet users among them is rising, it is imperative that a more suitable approach in interface design is explored.

Within a Cloud, elasticity of resource usage is typically realized through the “on-demand” provision principle supported by the “Pay-as-You-Go” business model. However, little, or no work, has investigated elasticity of algorithms for Cloud computing. In this paper, we introduce novel research on elastic algorithms (EA) where the computation itself is organized in a “Pay-as-You-Go” fashion. In contrast to conventional algorithms, where computation is a deterministic process that only produces an “ali-or-nothing” result, an EA generates a sequence of approximate results corresponding to its resource consumption. As more resources are consumed, better results will be derived. In this sense, the quality of the algorithm is elastic to its resource consumption. In the paper, we formalize the proeprties of elasticity and also formalize desirable properties for elastic algorithms themselves. We illustrate the design of an EA for kNN classification in the context of machine learning and discuss its properties. Finally we provide an ambitious agenda for future research in this area.","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6427500","Cloud computing;Pay-as-You-Go;elastic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Classification algorithms;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Elasticity;Investments","cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;resource allocation","EA;all-or-nothing;ambitious agenda;cloud computing;elastic algorithms;kNN classification;machine learning;on-demand provision principle;pay-as-you-go business model;resource consumption;resource usage elasticity","","1","","16","","","3-6 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here we investigate the thickness dependence of space charge accumulation in unfilled and LDPE doped with nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> over a range of temperatures in a field of 50 kV/mm. It is found that the space charge in LDPE/SiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites exhibits marked thickness dependence whereas in the unfilled LDPE it shows very little thickness dependence. A simulation based on the bipolar injection model and Takada's trapping potential model has been carried out in order to explain the differences.

"A message structure to communicate current/predicted surveillance service status","S. Bellingham; D. Scarlett","NAV CANADA, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","2015 Integrated Communication, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)","","2015","","","M3-1","M3-8","Surveillance systems such as ADS-B and Multi-Lateration Systems employ geographically distributed networks of sensors. The impacts of sensor outages on surveillance coverage can be complex, with operationally useful service retained through much of the service volume. For space-based ADS-B services, such as the Aireon system that will begin deployment this year, the service impact will have an extra dimension of complexity, since the sensors will not be stationary. The service impacts of sensor outages may be modelled a priori by the system provider, or by a service prediction tool delivered to the customer. The current and/or predicted service impacts may then be presented to air traffic controllers or system management specialists. To facilitate the transfer of geographically-based service prediction information from various surveillance systems or support tools to ATM operational platforms and integrated system monitoring platforms, a standard message structure is proposed. This message structure will support the description of a surveillance service volume as a set of tiles, and the indication of current and expected service status of each tile, individually or in groups, as a function of time. The message structure is scalable for a variety of surveillance applications, from airport surface movement to international space-based ADS-B.

"Virtualized sub-GHz transmission paired with mobile access for the Tactile Internet","O. Holland; S. Wong; V. Friderikos; Z. Qin; Y. Gao","King's College London, London, UK","2016 23rd International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)","","2016","","","1","5","The Tactile Internet has highly challenging technical requirements. For example, the end-to-end latency for the sensation of touch to be realistically conveyed to the end-user via communications, for the purpose of that end-user implementing control actions in response to that touch, must be less than 1 ms. This is equivalent to only 300 km propagation at the speed of light. Such constraints mean that many of the conventional approaches to communications, e.g., higher-layer retransmissions for reliability and congestion control, and even link-level retransmissions for reliability, can not apply. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for combining licensed access for reliability and control, with virtualized low-frequency sub-GHz access for good coverage and low latency, also removing receive-acknowledgement based reliability and congestion control mechanisms. Through the removal of these reliability/retransmission mechanisms, and by achieving a more direct path to the receivers through virtualization and better coverage maximizing (wireless) routing options, or even transmitting directly, this proposed solution minimizes latency and jitter while still being able to achieve the extremely challenging requirement for reliability of the Tactile Internet. We argue the benefits of our solution with reference to a major trial within the Ofcom TV White Spaces Pilot in the UK, as one readily-available means for such sub-GHz transmission. We also provide the example of such a realization as a viable means of achieving remote surgical operations across the London, UK area, with the surgeon(s) being physically located in only one or a small number of London hospitals.","","","10.1109/ICT.2016.7500442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500442","5G;applications;tactile/haptic communications;virtualization","5G mobile communication;Decision support systems;Security;Telecommunications;Virtualization","Internet;haptic interfaces;jitter;mobile computing;radio spectrum management;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;virtualisation","Ofcom TV White Spaces Pilot;Tactile Internet;UK;congestion control mechanisms;mobile access;reliability link-level retransmissions;speed of light propagation;virtualized sub-GHz transmission","","","","6","","","16-18 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed SJ-VDMOS, the P-pillar of the drift region is surrounded by a thin SiO<sub>2</sub> which prevents the injection of electrons from both the drain and the N-pillar region into the P-pillar region. Thus the stored charges are reduced. A diode D<sub>0</sub> integrated outside the edge terminal is used to conduct the electrons collected at the interface of the bottom polysilicon/SiO<sub>2</sub> generated during the turning-off state of the VDMOS to prevent pre-breakdown. Besides, a Schottky diode in parallel with the body diode is also integrated to further reduce the reverse recovery charges (Q<sub>rr</sub>). Simulation results show that the proposed SJ-VDMOS obtains the lowest Q<sub>rr</sub> = 54 nC without any lifetime control which reduces the total switching power loss in an invertor system to about 48 μJ for a 500 V SJ-VDMOS @ I = 1.6 A.","2164-5256;21645256","","10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203553","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7203553","","Charge carrier lifetime;Leakage currents;MOSFET;Power dissipation;Radiation effects;Schottky diodes;Switches","MOSFET;Schottky diodes;silicon compounds","N-pillar region;P-pillar region;Schottky diode;SiO<sub>2</sub>;body diode;current 1.6 A;drift region;energy 48 muJ;fast reverse recovery;invertor system;polysilicon;super-junction VDMOS;switching power loss;vertical diffused metal oxide semiconductor;voltage 500 V","","0","","8","","","9-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These CLs carry currents in the range of 10-68 kA. The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology successfully designed, built, and tested the 70-kA demonstrator CL for the ITER magnets, which was subsequently followed by the 18.2-kA HTS CLs for the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator and the 20-kA and 26-kA HTS CLs for the JT-60SA tokamak. All these CLs use the first-generation HTS material BSCCO. The HTS part of the CL is now the focus of a new development aiming at a substitution of BSCCO by the next-generation HTS material REBCO. To limit the heat load to the cryostat, the stabilizer material of the REBCO coated tapes requires a low thermal conductivity. In addition, stabilizers with a sufficiently high electrical conductivity are mandatory in order to protect the CL in case of a quench of the REBCO tapes. A part of this new development is therefore a detailed material property investigation of REBCO coated conductor single tapes with a low thermal conductivity, in order to define a suitable conductor for a 20-kA CL and to create a database for the subsequent technical optimization process. This paper summarizes the measurement results of the thermal conductivity, electric resistivity, and specific heat capacity for REBCO single tapes with a low heat leakage. The results are analyzed with regard to earlier investigations of the BSCCO tapes used in the Wendelstein CLs serving as a reference for a future REBCO CL.","1051-8223;10518223","","10.1109/TASC.2016.2522760","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7407337","Fusion Magnets;Fusion magnets;HTS Current leads;REBCO;high-temperature superconductor (HTS) current leads (CLs)","Bismuth compounds;Conductivity;Conductors;Heating;High-temperature superconductors;Superconducting magnets;Thermal conductivity","Tokamak devices;electrical conductivity;electrical resistivity;high-temperature superconductors;specific heat;superconducting magnets;superconducting tapes;thermal conductivity","ITER magnets;JT-60SA tokamak;REBCO coated conductor tapes;Wendelstein 7-X stellarator;current 10 kA to 68 kA;electric resistivity;electrical conductivity;high temperature superconductor current lead;specific heat capacity;stabilizer material;thermal conductivity;total cooling power consumption","","1","","28","","20160215","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Lazzi","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","","2013","7","1","11","23","Two-coil based inductive coupling is a commonly used technique for wireless power and data transfer for biomedical implants. Because the source and load resistances are finite, two-coil systems generally achieve a relatively low power transfer efficiency. A novel multi-coil technique (using more than two coils) for wireless power and data transfer is considered to help overcoming this limitation. The proposed multi-coil system is formulated using both network theory and a two-port model. Using three or four coils for the wireless link allows for the source and load resistances to be decoupled from the <i>Q</i>-factor of the coils, resulting in a higher <i>Q</i> -factor and a corresponding improved power transfer efficiency (PTE). Moreover, due to the strong coupling between the driver and the transmitter coil (and/or between the receiver and the load coil), the multi-coil system achieves higher tunable frequency bandwidth as compared to its same sized two-coil equivalent. Because of the wider range of reflected impedance in the multi-coil system case, it is easier to tune the output power to the load and achieve the maximum power transfer condition for given source voltage than in a configuration with two coils. Experimental results showing a three-coil system achieving twice the efficiency and higher gain-bandwidth product compared to its two-coil counterpart are presented. In addition, a figure of merit for telemetry systems is defined to quantify the overall telemetry system performance.","1932-4545;19324545","","10.1109/TBCAS.2012.2192115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6192334","Biomedical implant;efficient;energy efficient;inductive wireless power link;multi-coil;power transmission efficiency;resonance based power delivery;resonant coils;telemetry;wireless power transfer","Bandwidth;Coils;Couplings;Inductance;Receivers;Telemetry;Transmitters","Q-factor;biomedical telemetry;coils;prosthetic power supplies;radio links;radio receivers;radio transmitters","PTE;Q-factor;biomedical implants;data transfer;driver coil;gain-bandwidth;load coil;load resistance;low power transfer efficiency;multicoil telemetry system;network theory;receiver coil;source resistance;source voltage;telemetry system performance;three-coil system;transmitter coil;tunable frequency bandwidth;two-coil based inductive coupling;two-port model;wireless link;wireless power transfer","Humans;Models, Theoretical;Prostheses and Implants;Telemetry","40","","27","","20120430","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Maestro examines the program actions of the workers before deployment and automatically decides which worker actions can be executed locally (without contacting the master) and which actions require synchronization through the master. Maestro has applications in graph processing, real-time enterprise analysis, and web-services domains.

In the present study we extend the canonical model of decision making under uncertainty to examine how the value of real-time feedback varies with the turbulence of the decision environment. Additionally, we explored the complementarity of real-time feedback with a knowledge renewal capability that serves to unlearn out-of-date knowledge. Simulation results reveal an unexpected nonlinearity: a real-time feedback loop has a markedly greater positive impact on performance at moderate levels of turbulence that at high or low levels of turbulence. The impacts of knowledge renewal capacity, as we simulated it, are less clear-cut, and the two capabilities were not found to interact.

"GIG End-to-End Policy Based Network Management: A new approach to large-scale distributed automation","S. A. Davidson; M. C. Wang; S. Mohan; F. Bronzo; J. Zinky; J. Burchfiel","Raytheon NCS, USA","2011 - MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference","","2011","","","2011","2018","Providing seamless, reliable communications across the Global Information Grid (GIG) presents many unique challenges for network management. Beyond the fact that, as an entity, the GIG encompasses many diverse, operating environments (wired and wireless, tactical and strategic), it faces the challenge of operating a connected series of separate administrative domains which are each governed by different Services (and organizations with each of the services), Combatant Commands (COCOMs), and Agencies. At the same time, it is expected - in fact it is required - to operate as a seamless whole in order to support on-going missions - despite the challenges of a dynamically-changing environment and shifting mission priorities. Policy-Based Network Management (PBNM) is the name given to a set of emerging technologies that automate traditional network management (NM) functions. When PBNM is in use, networked entities (e.g., devices, files, information resources) behave as if they automatically sense and respond to network and service conditions by reacting automatically according to pre- programmed behaviors or policies. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) has systems engineering responsibility for portions of the GIG. DISA contracted Raytheon to develop a proposed architecture for GIG End-to-End PBNM. This DoDAF 2.0 architecture addresses user, operational, and technical aspects of PBNM (including policy hierarchy and structure of the ontology). The core of this candidate architecture is the innovative distributed Policy Management Entity, a replicated microcosm of the overall GIG PBNM architecture. The proposed architecture presented in this paper is in process of being ratified as part of the GIG Standard. This paper will introduce the reader to the complexities of the GIG and the general topic of PBNM. It will cover the process used to create the architecture, and will share highlights and key artifacts from this candidate architecture.","2155-7578;21557578","","10.1109/MILCOM.2011.6127614","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6127614","","Architecture;Automation;Computer architecture;Data models;Performance evaluation;Protocols;US Department of Defense","computer network management","DISA;GIG end-to-end policy based network management;conference combatant commands;defense information system agency;end-to-end PBNM;large-scale distributed automation","","1","","5","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reduce the overhead cost due to communications, most of the existing distributed clustering approaches generates global models by aggregating local results obtained on each individual node. The complexity and quality of solutions depend highly on the quality of the aggregation. In this respect, we propose distributed density-based clustering that both reduces the communication overheads and improves the quality of the global models by considering the shapes of local clusters. From preliminary results we show that this algorithm is very promising.","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146985","balance vector;clustering;distributed data mining;distributed platform;large datasets","Algorithm design and analysis;Bismuth;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Merging;Shape;Vectors","computational complexity;knowledge acquisition;pattern clustering","datasets;distributed density based clustering;knowledge extraction;overhead cost reduction;solution complexity;solution quality","","0","","20","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The filter consists of three specialized sub-filter stages which respectively provide passive response in low frequencies, actively tunable response in mid-band frequencies and ultra-steep roll-off at transition frequencies from pass-band to stop-band. The sub-filters are implemented in balanced ladder topology using floating active inductors. Measured results from the fabricated chip show that wide range of mid-band tuning including gain tuning of over 20dB, Q factor tuning from 2 to 19 as well as the bio-realistic center frequency shift are achieved by adjusting only one circuit parameter. Besides, the filter has an ultra-steep roll-off reaching over 300 dB/dec. By changing biasing currents, the filter can be configured to operate with center frequencies from 31 Hz to 8 kHz. The filter is 9<sup>th</sup> order, consumes 59.5 ~ 90.0 μW power and occupies 0.9 mm<sup>2</sup> chip area.

"Fast converging digital MPPT control for photovoltaic (PV) applications","S. Patel; W. Shireen","","2011 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","","2011","","","1","6","In order to compensate for their cost, photovoltaic (PV) systems need to be operated in a manner that ensures the optimum use of the available solar energy. This is achieved by means of a Power Conditioning Unit (PCU) which in most cases consists of a dc-dc converter connected between the PV source and the load. The role of the dc-dc converter control is to ensure operation of the PV array at its maximum power point (MPP) regardless of atmospheric conditions and load variations.

On the other hand, current health programs for cardiac rehabilitation are expensive [2] and force the patients to miss working time to go to rehabilitation centers for assisted training.

This paper suggests that the designer can improve system's behavior by substituting (part of) regular interactions with smart mediated interactions that bolster up shared situation awareness of the system's components and thus strengthens system's capability to monitor and partially control its emergent behavior. This paper discusses smart mediated interactions that focus on awareness of temporal features and on estimates of spatial location of the components.

Of all the known interconnect technologies, nanostructure interconnects such as nanocrystalline Cu are the most promising technology to meet the high mechanical reliability and electrical requirements of next generation devices. However, there is a need to fully characterize their fatigue properties. In this research, numerical analysis has been employed to study the semi-elliptical crack growth and shape evolution in nanostructured interconnects subject to uniaxial fatigue loading. The results indicate that nanocrystalline copper is in fact a suitable candidate for ultra-fine pitch interconnects applications. This study also predicts that crack growth is a relatively small portion of the total fatigue life of interconnects under LCF conditions. Hence, crack initiation life is the main factor in determining the fatigue life of interconnects.","","","10.1109/ESIME.2011.5765849","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5765849","","Closed-form solution;Copper;Integral equations;Plastics;Strain","copper alloys;fatigue cracks;fine-pitch technology;flip-chip devices;integrated circuit interconnections;integrated circuit packaging;nanostructured materials;numerical analysis;reliability","Cu;flip chip technology;integrated chip packages;lead-based solder materials;low cycle fatigue crack growth;mechanical reliability;nanocrystalline copper;nanostructure copper;nanostructure interconnects;next generation devices;numerical analysis;semielliptical crack growth;size 90 nm;uniaxial fatigue loading","","1","","22","","","18-20 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proximity of base stations to subscribers brings many possibilities for the development of new applications, including new offerings based on cloud computing. Smartphones can directly offload applications to close base stations, provided that these are equipped with additional computational and storage resources. The cloud concept applied in the framework of small cells can also combine radio and computation aspects in order to optimise the service delivery. This paper introduces a new element called the Small Cell Manager (SCM), which optimises the overall operation of a cluster of cloud-enabled small cells. The SCM, aware of the cluster situation in terms of both radio and cloud aspects, interacts not only with the cloud-enabled base stations, but also with LTE core network components. To that end, different possibilities for the general architecture of a small-cell-cloud are analysed. Furthermore, the paper describes different evaluation criteria an LTE operator has to consider before adopting this approach in order to optimise the required investment and maximise benefits.","","","10.1109/WCNCW.2014.6934851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6934851","LTE;computation offloading;femtocells;mobile cloud computing;network architecture;small cell manager;small cells","Complexity theory;Irrigation;Maintenance engineering;Security","Long Term Evolution;cellular radio;cloud computing;mobile computing","LTE core network component;SCM;base station;cloud computing;cloud-enabled LTE small cell network;mobile computation offloading;service delivery optimisation;small cell manager;smartphone;wireless traffic demand","","8","","4","","","6-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proofs of principle ensued. Aim: To assess minimum requirements of the signal for PCA to successfully recover it, in terms of temporal resolution, of total counts needed and of strength of the motion signal in the data. The use of Time-Of-Flight technology, to increase signal-to-background ratio was investigated to see whether it would give improved results. Materials and methods: A General Electrics Medical Systems Discovery-690 PET/CT was used. A phantom with an uniform background and hot spherical sources placed on a moving platform was used. Motion period was set to about 4 seconds and motion range at 10 mm and 20 mm. The motion was recorded with an RPM device. PCA was applied to obtain motion signals with 80, 160 and 320 ms sampling. It was applied to data relative to 327, 163, 81 and 41 seconds of total acquisition time. The correlation to the RPM signal, which for this phantom is virtually noiseless, was used to measure the power of PCA signal to be an effective indicator of the motion signal. PCA was applied to TOF, traditional non-TOF data and non-TOF data with a rejection for all events with a time signature indicating events outside a 40 cm diameter. Data were also analyzed for a cardiac scan of a patient, with samplings of 20, 40 and 80 ms, to try to recover both cardiac and respiratory signal. Results: Correlation coefficients of 0.80 or greater were found in all cases for the phantom with 20 mm motion. For the 10 mm motion markedly lower correlations are found. At 80 ms temporal resolution the correlations are too low or absent to allow motion signal extraction. High enough values (r>0.7) are found only at 320 ms sampling for 81 s (or longer) acquisitions or at 160 ms sampling for 327 s acquisitions.

Here, we design an original measurement approach targeting reliable estimation of the degree distribution of core routers, without resorting to any map. It consists in sampling random core routers and precisely estimate their degree thanks to probes sent from many distributed monitors. We run and assess a large-scale measurement following this approach, carefully controlling and correcting bias and errors encountered in practice.

However, like OFDM, one main disadvantage of MIMO-OFDM is that the signals transmitted on different antennas might exhibit a prohibitively large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Partial transmit sequence (PTS) provides attractive PAPR reduction performance in OFDM or MIMO-OFDM. Unfortunately, it leads to prohibitively large computational complexity. In this paper, types of low-complexity PTS schemes are proposed to reduce the PAPR for MIMO-OFDM systems that use Firefly algorithm (FA) and space-frequency block codes (SFBC). Simulation results show that FA based on PTS can reduce computational complexity dramatically and achieve better PAPR reduction performance compared to ordinary PTS.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3071-2; POD:978-1-5090-3072-9","10.1109/IS3C.2016.217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7545327","Firefly algorithm;Multiple-input multiple-output;Partial transmit sequence;Peak-to-average power ratio","Computational complexity;Optimization;Partial transmit sequences;Peak to average power ratio;Signal processing algorithms;Transmitting antennas","MIMO communication;OFDM modulation;block codes;wireless LAN","PAPR reduction;PTS based firefly algorithm scheme;PTS schemes;SFBC MIMO-OFDM communication systems;WLAN systems;multiple-input multiple output signal processing;next generation wireless local area network systems;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;partial transmit sequence;peak-to-average power ratio;space frequency block codes","","","","","","","4-6 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The number and length of level segments flown during arrival and departure operations can be reduced by procedure design which leverages the advantages of Area Navigation (RNAV) to reduce actual level flight. Such design must take into account many factors including terrain, current route of a particular flow of air traffic, other proximate air traffic flows, aircraft equipage, and air traffic control (ATC) needs. Variation of these factors between airports can make comparison difficult, whether between sites or over time. Recent studies, performed by The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), have led to the development of a methodology for analyzing traffic flow vertical profiles for the purpose of reducing fuel burn and emissions in transition airspace. The methodology is flexible enough to be meaningfully applied to airports across the United States National Airspace System (NAS), while still having the specificity to reflect site specific vertical profile improvements. For example, in one recent study using this standardized methodology, over 4,000 traffic flows were identified for 48 airports across the NAS. Results were examined at the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), airport, flow, and individual segment level of detail, enabling support for national planning efforts as well as local procedure design.

As a consequence, hierarchical platforms emerge in which cores inside a multi-core chip interact by on-chip networks whereas multi-core chips are interconnected by off-chip networks. This paper presents gateways for establishing such a hierarchical platform.

Studies using isolated retinas also observed a decline in RGC spiking response rate during repetitive stimulation. The mechanism(s) underlying this response rate decline could also contribute to the fading percepts in human patients. Using patch clamp recordings of rabbit retinas, we found a frequency-dependent inactivation of RGC voltage-gated sodium channels during repetitive stimulation at ≥ 50 Hz.

"Bursting the Cloud Data Bubble: Towards Transparent Storage Elasticity in IaaS Clouds","B. Nicolae; P. Riteau; K. Keahey","IBM Res., Dublin, Ireland","Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, 2014 IEEE 28th International","","2014","","","135","144","Storage elasticity on IaaS clouds is an important feature for data-intensive workloads: storage requirements can vary greatly during application runtime, making worst-case over-provisioning a poor choice that leads to unnecessarily tied-up storage and extra costs for the user. While the ability to adapt dynamically to storage requirements is thus attractive, how to implement it is not well understood. Current approaches simply rely on users to attach and detach virtual disks to the virtual machine (VM) instances and then manage them manually, thus greatly increasing application complexity while reducing cost efficiency. Unlike such approaches, this paper aims to provide a transparent solution that presents a unified storage space to the VM in the form of a regular POSIX file system that hides the details of attaching and detaching virtual disks by handling those actions transparently based on dynamic application requirements. The main difficulty in this context is to understand the intent of the application and regulate the available storage in order to avoid running out of space while minimizing the performance overhead of doing so. To this end, we propose a storage space prediction scheme that analyzes multiple system parameters and dynamically adapts monitoring based on the intensity of the I/O in order to get as close as possible to the real usage. We show the value of our proposal over static worst-case over-provisioning and simpler elastic schemes that rely on a reactive model to attach and detach virtual disks, using both synthetic benchmarks and real-life data-intensive applications. Our experiments demonstrate that we can reduce storage waste/cost by 30-40% with only 2-5% performance overhead.","1530-2075;15302075","","10.1109/IPDPS.2014.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877249","I/O access pattern prediction;adaptive resizing;cloud computing;elastic storage","Aerospace electronics;Context;Correlation;Elasticity;History;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms","cloud computing;data handling;storage management;virtual machines","I/O intensity;IaaS clouds;VM instances;application complexity;cloud data bubble;cost efficiency reduction;data-intensive workloads;multiple system parameter analysis;performance overhead minimization;reactive model;regular POSIX file system;static worst-case over-provisioning;storage space prediction scheme;tied-up storage;transparent storage elasticity;unified storage space;virtual disks;virtual machine","","6","","33","","","19-23 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The project has performed research into issues faced by EU refugees when seeking employment and has worked with these refugees to co-develop games-based learning (GBL) applications to improve the employability of refugees in the UK, Ireland and Germany. Training resources developed as part of this project include detailed specifications of learning outcomes, adaptations of existing curricula and serious games presented as either desktop or mobile applications. These resources now require careful organisation and publication as part of a 'Trainer's Handbook' to provide guidance for using the project results in a blended and flexible learning approach. Previous studies have aimed to consolidate these materials into a single educational framework which requires careful consideration of the social, educational, organisational and technological issues associated with embedding games in education. Previous work such as the Virtual Portal for Interaction and ICT Training for People with Disabilities (VIPI) project has created an online 'portal' of resources using a blended pedagogical framework to maximise learning and to provide a package that caters for the needs of a wide variety of users. This 'Handbook' provides a blueprint on how to optimally use the developed platform (including its tools, services, training material and games) and integrate it within current training practices. This paper will discuss how the VIPI framework has been adapted as part of the RISE project.

To further sustain the scalability of these file systems, researchers and HPC storage architects are exploring various storage system designs. One proposed storage system design integrates a tier of solid-state burst buffers into the storage system to absorb application I/O requests. In this paper, we simulate and explore this storage system design for use by large-scale HPC systems. First, we examine application I/O patterns on an existing large-scale HPC system to identify common burst patterns. Next, we describe enhancements to the CODES storage system simulator to enable our burst buffer simulations. These enhancements include the integration of a burst buffer model into the I/O forwarding layer of the simulator, the development of an I/O kernel description language and interpreter, the development of a suite of I/O kernels that are derived from observed I/O patterns, and fidelity improvements to the CODES models. We evaluate the I/O performance for a set of multiapplication I/O workloads and burst buffer configurations. We show that burst buffers can accelerate the application perceived throughput to the external storage system and can reduce the amount of external storage bandwidth required to meet a desired application perceived throughput goal.","2160-195X;2160195X","","10.1109/MSST.2012.6232369","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6232369","","Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Computational modeling;Kernel;Protocols;Throughput","buffer storage;file organisation;input-output programs;parallel architectures;parallel machines;program interpreters","CODES storage system simulator;HPC storage architecture;I/O forwarding layer;I/O kernel description language;I/O pattern;I/O request;bandwidth aggregation;burst buffer model;high-performance system;interpreter;large-scale HPC system;leadership class storage system;multiapplication I/O workload;parallel file system;solid-state burst buffer;storage system design","","41","2","44","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, low signal-to-noise ratio and significant data variation of EEG make it very difficult for BCI to obtain reliable results. Spatial filtering is one of the most successful feature extraction methods, and many efforts have been made to construct spatial filters that are robust against the data nonstationarity. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial filter optimization method based on mutual information which is estimated by Gaussian functions instead of Parzen window. We analyze the relationship between the mutual information and feature distance using a simulation study to show that optimization based on mutual information can contribute to feature stationarity. Moreover, we also evaluate the proposed method on a real world motor imagery EEG data set recorded from 16 subjects performing motor imagery or staying in idle state. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed spatial filter optimization method as it outperforms both the common spatial pattern analysis and filter-bank common spatial pattern analysis.","","","10.1109/ICICS.2015.7459833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7459833","","Brain modeling;Covariance matrices;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Linear programming;Mutual information;Optimization","Gaussian processes;brain-computer interfaces;channel bank filters;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;optimisation;spatial filters","BCI;EEG signals;Gaussian functions;brain computer interface;data nonstationarity;electroencephalography;feature distance;feature extraction methods;feature stationarity;filter-bank common spatial pattern analysis;motor imagery EEG data set;mutual information;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial filter subspace optimization","","","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Over the years we are witnessing an ever increasing demand for functionality enhancements in the embedded real-time systems. Along with the functionalities, the design itself grows more complex. Posed constraints, such as energy consumption, time, and space bounds, also require attention and proper handling. Additionally, efficient scheduling algorithms, as proven through analyses and simulations, often impose requirements that have significant run-time cost, specially in the context of multi-core systems. In order to further investigate the behaviour of such systems to quantify and compare these overheads involved, we have developed the SPARTS, a simulator of a generic embedded real- time device. The tasks in the simulator are described by externally visible parameters (e.g. minimum inter-arrival, sporadicity, WCET, BCET, etc.), rather than the code of the tasks. While our current implementation is primarily focused on our immediate needs in the area of power-aware scheduling, it is designed to be extensible to accommodate different task properties, scheduling algorithms and/or hardware models for the application in wide variety of simulations.

Whereas technical solutions have been tested for more than 20 years, psychological effects of highly automated driving became subject to debate in the last decade. Recent studies revealed that switching from highly automated to manual driving mode produces some difficulties for drivers. Therefore, the present driving simulator study investigates drivers' performance before (pre-automation) and after (post-automation) highly automated convoy driving (platooning). Hence it represents a more fine granulated analysis of a simulator experiment from Skottke et al. [1]. The pre-/post-comparison of driver performance shows whether driving behavior is more risky after 33km (20 min.) of highly automated driving in a platoon with a time headway of 0.3 sec.. Results showed that drivers significantly decreased their distance to the lead vehicle in the post-automation driving period compared to their pre-automation duration. Moreover, lateral vehicle control and driving speed differed between pre- and post-automation periods as well. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that highly automated driving critically affects drivers' post-automation behavior. Consequences for subsequent empirical research and technological developments are discussed.","2153-0009;21530009","","10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958168","","Automation;Manuals;Psychology;Roads;Standards;Switches;Vehicles","traffic engineering computing","highly automated convoy driving;highly automated driving mode;lateral vehicle control;manual driving mode","","0","","11","","","8-11 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simulations are used to propagate the acoustic field through a histologically measured representation of the human abdomen and to validate the theoretical predictions. In vivo measurements performed with a diagnostic ultrasound scanner demonstrate show that simulations and theory closely match the measured spatial coherence characteristics in the human body.

Although such predictions are inherently uncertain, applications typically assume that they are completely accurate. This assumption can lead to incorrect decisions resulting in unnecessary delays, wasted resources, or worse. Instead, prediction error should be a fundamental consideration in mobile systems. Applications should consider uncertainty when weighing alternatives. When one alternative is not clearly superior to another, redundant strategies are often appropriate, resulting in much better performance at a very modest cost. To illustrate these ideas, we describe and implement several methods for quantifying uncertainty in mobile environments. Our system allows applications to explicitly weigh the tradeoff between the performance gained via redundancy and the cost of extra energy and cellular data resources spent, tailoring decisions to their relative importance. We adapt two systems to use this approach. Compared to both simple and adaptive strategies that do not reflect prediction error, our library improves application performance by up to a factor of two.","","","10.4108/icst.mobicase.2014.257722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7026274","","Libraries","mobile computing","application performance;mobile applications;mobile environments;mobile systems;prediction error;uncertainty","","0","","34","","","6-7 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The digital microfluidic array has been partitioned both laterally as well as longitudinally and within each part a test droplet moves on. These test droplets follow a eulerian route within their designated partition or cluster for bidirectional movement through each cell. Partitioning the digital microfluidic array in the proposed fashion not only reduces the number of testing steps but also testing time to a great extent compared to previous methods.","2325-940X;2325940X","","10.1109/INDICON.2014.7030367","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030367","clusters;digital microfluidic biochip;eulerian route;overlap of cells;partitioning;path length;weighted retrace","Arrays;Conference proceedings;Conferences;Electrodes;Microfluidics;Routing;Testing","bioMEMS;cellular biophysics;drops;lab-on-a-chip;microfluidics","bio-MEMS;cell based structure;digital microfluidic array;digital microfluidic biochip;microelectromechanical systems;partitioning technique;structural testing;test droplet","","0","","15","","","11-13 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The case against a carbon tax for South Africa","P. Lloyd","Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, South Africa","2011 Proceedings of the 8th Conference on the Industrial and Commercial Use of Energy","","2011","","","168","173","Treasury has made a proposal that there should be a carbon tax in South Africa. In its Discussion Paper, the rationale for the tax is given as “Climate change and its effects are the result of GHG emissions, which are not paid for by the emitters. Such emissions impose external costs on society - an “externality” in economic terms. Because these costs have not been factored into the prices of goods and services, this is a “market failure”, which can be corrected by a pricing instrument.” But greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions are global, and the South African contribution is minor. If one accepts that the polluter should pay, then the major polluters should pay the major burden and the minor polluters a lesser burden of the external costs caused. Of course, there is an assumption that the external costs can be quantified and agreed. If the debate around climate change is any guide, there is not likely to be any agreement on the sources, let alone the magnitude, of the external costs any time soon. That should not, however, detract from the underlying principle, which is widely accepted, that the polluter should pay. In this sense, it is totally inappropriate to consider a tax on South Africans that approaches the levels accepted by the EU, and certainly not before the North Americans have made equivalent commitments. Yet this is what Treasury proposes. It is argued that a tax on carbon constitutes a tax on energy consumption, and that because energy consumption and economic development are directly correlated, a carbon tax on South Africa is in fact a tax on development, and should therefore be rejected out of hand.","2166-0581;21660581","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033102","","Bibliographies;Carbon dioxide;Carbon tax;Green products;Instruments","energy consumption;environmental factors","EU;North Americans;South Africa;Treasury;carbon tax;climate change;economic development;energy consumption;greenhouse gas emissions","","0","","8","","","16-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Evaluating Reconfiguration Impact in Self-Adaptive Systems -- An Approach Based on Combinatorial Interaction Testing","S. Sen; S. D. Alesio; D. Marijan; A. Sarkar","","2015 41st Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications","","2015","","","250","254","Self-adaptive software adapts its behavior to the operational context via automatic run-time reconfiguration of software components. Particular reconfigurations may negatively affect the system Quality of Service (QoS), and therefore their impact over the system performance needs to be thoroughly evaluated. In this paper, we present an approach, based on Combinatorial Interaction Testing (CIT), that generates a sequence of configurations aimed at evaluating the extent to which reconfigurations affect the system QoS. Specifically, we transform a Classification Tree Models (CTM) of the configurations domain to a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) in ALLOY, whose solution is a sequence of reconfigurations achieving T-wise coverage between system features, and R-wise coverage between configurations in the sequence. The resolution of the CSP is performed by an incremental growth algorithm that divides the generation of the sequence into sub-problems, and merges the results into a final set of test configurations. Preliminary validation in a self adaptive vision system shows that our methodology effectively identifies critical reconfigurations exhibiting a high variation in QoS. This result encourages the use of CIT as a strategy to evaluate the performance of self-adaptive systems.","1089-6503;10896503","","10.1109/SEAA.2015.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7302459","classification tree modeling;combinatorial interaction coverage;performance testing;qos evaluation;reconfiguration impact;self-adaptive sytems","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Metals;Quality of service;Runtime;Software;Testing","constraint satisfaction problems;program testing;software performance evaluation;software quality;trees (mathematics)","ALLOY;CIT;CSP;CTM;R-wise coverage;T-wise coverage;automatic run-time reconfiguration;behavior adaptation;classification tree model;combinatorial interaction testing;constraint satisfaction problem;critical reconfigurations;incremental growth algorithm;self adaptive vision system;self-adaptive software;self-adaptive system;software components;system QoS;system features;system performance evaluation;system quality of service","","","","","","","26-28 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe a protocol, named ""Reliability Map Routing"" (RMR), which uses end-to-end Quality of Service metrics that include spatial reliability and trust. The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

MANETs stands for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks and is a comparatively new technology and studies have been in progress to make it a more reliable technology. Message passing interface is a basic portable message-passing interface designed to function on several computers at once. It is regularly integrated where there is the need of high speed computing. This paper describes the use of Message Passing Interface which is in preference to MapReduce in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks to process large and complex data. Here each node in the given network can use partially reserved CPU cycles and the other nodes in the network are used to carry out processing of data in an affordable manner using various architectures of distributed computing. This allows smaller organizations to gather refined information in a much easier way and that too without the need of huge amounts of server to do the same.","","CD:978-1-4673-9754-4; Electronic:978-1-4673-9756-8; POD:978-1-4673-9757-5","10.1109/CCOMS.2015.7562883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7562883","Big Data;Distributed and parallel computing;MapReduce;Message Passing Interface (MPI);Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs)","Ad hoc networks;Distributed databases;Message passing;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","Big Data;message passing;mobile ad hoc networks","Big Data processing;MANET;MapReduce;message passing interface;mobile ad-hoc networks","","","","","","","2-3 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, rectifier is suitable to use in biomedical implantable devices with low voltage power supplies over RF link. Leakage current through bulk has been reduced due to lowering on resistance, which is reduced because of biasing the bulk of the transistor with Dynamic Bulk Switching (DBS) technique.

The company's own optical infrastructure is primarily used for the purposes of business and process network. Because of their geographical setting, certain substations cannot be connected by optical cables. Instead, rented connections are being used, and, more and more often, wireless connections that help reduce renting costs and increase safety. In substations, business network (e-mail, internet, intranet...) is used occasionally, and process network (systems of remote guidance, measuring, managing...) is used constantly whereby it is necessary to separate the data flow of these two networks. The usual way to separate these two networks within the optical infrastructure is by means of VRF-Lite technology, which should also be implemented for the wireless connections of substations. This makes the wireless technology even more complex. Increased data safety, the availability of the wireless network, and return on investment in wireless equipment justify the use of this technology for the purpose of connecting substations in a unique IP network of HEP.

Also, the gain factor increases with decrease of the transformer turns ratio, γ<sub>Γ</sub>. Small transformer turn ratio results in more practical topology in some voltage gains. It makes the transformer design easier and reduces construction cost. Also, in the proposed topology, the input and output voltages share the same ground. In order to avoid voltage and current spikes on the switches, a commutation strategy is proposed and safe commutation is achieved without using a snubber circuit.

In this paper, we investigate cloud-assisted collaborative execution for mobile applications with general task topology to reduce the energy consumption on mobile devices. A mobile application consists of fine-grained tasks organized in general topology. Each task can be executed either on the mobile device or offloaded to the cloud for execution, which is referred to as collaborative task execution. We aim to minimize the energy consumption on the mobile device while meeting a time deadline, by strategically mapping the task execution to the mobile device or to the cloud. We formulate the collaborative task execution as a delay-constrained workflow scheduling problem. For the workflow scheduling, we first leverage partial critical path analysis (PCP) to find out the critical path formed by a set of critical parents, in which the critical parent is defined as the parent node of a task that results in the maximum value of the earliest start time of the task. Then, for each path, we find its sub-deadline and apply one-climb policy to schedule the tasks on the path, in which there exists at most one migration from the mobile device to the cloud if ever for the minimum energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed collaborative task execution can save energy consumption compared to the local execution and is more flexible than the remote execution.","1550-3607;15503607","","10.1109/ICC.2015.7249412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7249412","","Collaboration;Delays;Energy consumption;Mobile handsets;Scheduling;Scheduling algorithms;Topology","cloud computing;critical path analysis;groupware;mobile computing;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling","PCP;cloud-assisted collaborative execution;collaborative task execution;delay-constrained workflow scheduling problem;energy consumption minimization;energy consumption reduction;fine-grained task;general task topology;mobile applications;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;one-climb policy;partial critical path analysis","","1","","15","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of the applied contact pressure and composite elastic modulus on the tangential ac BDS of the solid-solid interfaces experimentally. In the experiments, three different contact pressures were applied using different mechanical loads with two different materials having different elastic moduli, i.e. cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) and silicon rubber (SiR). Two rectangular prism shaped samples were placed between two vertical Rogowski shaped electrodes either in air or oil. The type of the interface (air/oil) is highlighted duly upon showing the results. Increase in contact pressure caused relatively higher increase in the tangential BDS of dry SiR-SiR (assembled in air) than that of XLPE-XLPE, revealing that elastic modulus facilitated significantly to reduce the mean void size in SiR that in turn improved the tangential BDS. Likewise, the tangential BDS of hybrid interfaces formed by XLPE-SiR specimens increased by 43% compared to that of XLPE-XLPE interface at the same pressure. Additionally, the same set of experiments assembled in oil reveals that the presence of oil enhanced the tangential BDSs around 2-3 times for all three-interface cases. Moreover, with the increase of applied pressure the tangential BDS of air-filled and oil-filled cavities tended to get significantly higher.","1070-9878;10709878","","10.1109/TDEI.2016.005744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7534663","Cable insulation;dielectric breakdown strength;elastic modulus","Decision support systems;Electric breakdown","XLPE insulation;assembling;dielectric materials;electric breakdown;electrodes;oils;power cable insulation;silicone rubber","BDS;XLPE-SiR specimen;air-filled cavity;assembling;composite elastic modulus;contact pressure;cross-linked polyethylene;electric field;mechanical load;microscopic cavity;oil-filled cavity;power cable;rectangular prism shaped sample;silicon rubber;solid dielectrics;solid-solid interface;tangential AC breakdown strength;vertical Rogowski shaped electrode","","","","","","","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For an application, this continuity has to be sufficiently transparent both from a performance perspective as well as a Quality of Experience (QoE) perspective. While mobility protocols (MIPv6, HIP, SCTP, DSMIP, PMIP, and SIP) strive to provide both and do so, limited or non-availability (deployment) of these protocols on provider networks and server side infrastructure has impeded adoption of mobility on end user platforms. Add to this, the cumbersome OS configuration procedures required to enable mobility protocol support on end user devices and the user's enthusiasm to add this support is lost. Considering the lack of proper mobility implementations that meet the remote healthcare requirements above, we propose SeaMo+ that comprises a light-weight application layer framework, termed as the Virtual Real-time Multimedia Service (VRMS) for mobile devices to provide an uninterrupted realtime multimedia information access to the mobile user. VRMS is easy to configure, platform independent, and does not require additional network infrastructure unlike other existing schemes.

In particular, thanks to mobile technologies, customers can make purchases in a faster and cheaper way than visiting stores, and business companies can increase their sales volume due to a world-wide visibility. Moreover, online trading systems allow customers to gather all the required information about product quality and characteristics, via customer reviews, and make an informed purchase. Due to the fact that these reviews are used to determine the extent of customers acceptance and satisfaction of a product or service, they can affect the future selling performance and market share of a company because they can also be used by companies to determine the success of a product, and predict its demand. As a consequence, tools for efficiently classifying textual customer reviews are becoming a key component of each e-commerce development framework to enable business companies to define the most suitable selling strategies and improve their market capabilities. This paper introduces an innovative framework for efficiently analysing customer sentiments in textual reviews in order to compute their corresponding numerical rating to allow companies to better plan their future business activities. The proposed approach addresses different issues involved in this significant task: the dimension and imprecision of ratings data. As shown in experimental results, the proposed hybrid approach yields better learning performance than other state of the art rating predictors.","","","10.1109/IA.2014.7009461","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009461","","Companies;Databases;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Natural language processing;Vectors","Internet;customer satisfaction;electronic commerce","Internet;business activities;business companies;customer acceptance;customer satisfaction;customer sentiments;e-commerce development framework;e-commerce reviews;hybrid computational intelligence;innovative framework;marketing;mobile technologies;online trading systems;online transactions;sales volume;textual customer reviews;world-wide visibility","","0","","32","","","9-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many privacy concerns have recently been raised due to the centralized nature of such services. Decentralized Social Network (DSN) is believed to be a viable solution for these problems. In this paper, we design a protocol to coordinate the pulling operation of DSN nodes. The protocol is the result of forward engineering via utility maximization that takes communication layer congestion level as well as social network layer centrality into consideration. We solve the pulling rate control problem using the primal-dual approach and prove that the protocol can converge quickly when executed in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, we develop a novel “drumbeats” algorithm to estimate node centrality purely based on passively-observed information. Simulation results show that our protocol reduces the average message propagation delay by 15% when comparing to the baselined Fixed Equal Gap Pull protocol. In addition, the estimated node centrality matches well with the ground-truth derived from the actual topology of the social network.","0743-166X;0743166X","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218652","","Algorithm design and analysis;Measurement;Optimization;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Social network services;Topology","protocols;social networking (online);telecommunication traffic","DPCP;communication layer congestion;decentralized social networks;drumbeats algorithm;fixed equal gap pull protocol;social network layer;social networking service","","0","","15","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This integration helps the vehicles have steady Internet connection through UMTS network and at the same time can communicate with other vehicles. However, the dead spot areas and unsuccessfully handoff processes due to the high speed of the vehicles can disrupt the implementation of this kind of architecture. In this paper, a new Simplified Gateway Selection (SGS) scheme for multihop relay in VANET-UMTS integration network is proposed. The main aim of this research is to enhance the integration between VANET and UMTS network, and extend the coverage in the area where there is no coverage, and reduce the amount of overhead, and reduce delay metrics, and increasing the packet delivery ratio, and also to reduce the dead spot in VANET-UMTS network. An enhanced version of HWMP is a combination of IEEE802.11p and IEEE802.11s for multihop vehicular communications is proposed. An integrated simulation environment combined of VanetMobiSim and NS2 is used to simulate and evaluate the proposed scheme. The simulations results show that, E-HWMP protocol performed better than Ad-hoc on demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol. Furthermore, E-HWMP is compared with other cluster-based gateway selection that used in the previous works; the result shows that our E-HWMP protocol outperforms the other cluster based gateway selections schemes in terms of connection delay, control packet overhead, packet delivery ratio and overall throughput.","","","10.1109/ICCEEE.2013.6633899","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6633899","E-HWMP;Mesh;UMTS;VANET;WAVE","3G mobile communication;Logic gates;Measurement;Protocols;Relays;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks","3G mobile communication;protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless LAN;wireless mesh networks","E-HWMP protocol;IEEE802.11p;IEEE802.11s;Internet connection;NS2;SGS scheme;UMTS network;VANET-UMTS integration network;VanetMobiSim;connection delay;control packet overhead;dead spot areas;delay metrics;enhanced hybrid wireless mesh protocol;integrated simulation environment;machine-to-machine applications;multihop relay;multihop vehicular communications;overall throughput;packet delivery ratio;simplified gateway selection scheme;universal mobile telecommunication system;vehicular ad-hoc network","","3","","17","","","26-28 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Often they are launched from Malware Distribution Networks (MDNs) consisting of landing pages to attract traffic, intermediate redirection servers, and exploit servers which attempt the compromise. In this paper, we present a novel approach to discovering the landing pages that lead to drive-by downloads. Starting from partial knowledge of a given collection of MDNs we identify the malicious content on their landing pages using multiclass feature selection. We then query the webpage cache of a commercial search engine to identify landing pages containing the same or similar content. In this way we are able to identify previously unknown landing pages belonging to already identified MDNs, which allows us to expand our understanding of the MDN. We explore using both a rule-based and classifier approach to identifying potentially malicious landing pages. We build both systems and independently verify using a high-interaction honeypot that the newly identified landing pages indeed attempt drive-by downloads. For the rule-based system 57% of the landing pages predicted as malicious are confirmed, and this success rate remains constant in two large trials spaced five months apart. This extends the known footprint of the MDNs studied by 17%. The classifier-based system is less successful, and we explore possible reasons.","1530-0889;15300889","","10.1109/DSN.2013.6575316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575316","Drive-by download;malware distribution network;signature","Browsers;Crawlers;Feature extraction;IP networks;Malware;Search engines;Servers","Internet;cache storage;invasive software;knowledge based systems;query processing;search engines;telecommunication traffic","MDN;Web page cache;browser vulnerabilities;commercial search engine;drive-by download attacks;high-interaction honeypot;intermediate redirection servers;malicious content identification;malicious landing page detection;malware distribution networks;multiclass feature selection;traffic attraction","","1","","26","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Finally, we analyze tradeoffs in the distributed coordination domain and identify promising future directions for achieving more scalable distributed coordination systems.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2279-3; POD:978-1-5090-2280-9","10.1109/ICCCN.2016.7568499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7568499","","Cloud computing;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Google;Nominations and elections;Protocols;Synchronization","","","","","","","","","1-4 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our merge sort is designed to use more register communication (not shared memory), and does not suffer from over-segmentation as opposed to previous comparison based sorts. Using these techniques we are able to achieve a sorting rate of 250 MKeys/sec, which is about 2.5 times faster than Thrust merge sort performance, and 70% faster than non-stable state-of-the-art GPU merge sorts. Building on this sorting algorithm, we develop a scheme for sorting variable-length key/value pairs, with a special emphasis on string keys. Sorting non-uniform, unaligned data such as strings is a fundamental step in a variety of algorithms, yet it has received comparatively little attention. To our knowledge, our system is the first published description of an efficient string sort for GPUs.

Jacob","University of Maryland, USA","Computer Architecture (ISCA), 2012 39th Annual International Symposium on","","2012","","","392","403","The design and implementation of the commodity memory architecture has resulted in significant performance and capacity limitations. To circumvent these limitations, designers and vendors have begun to place intermediate logic between the CPU and DRAM. This additional logic has two functions: to control the DRAM and to communicate with the CPU over a fast and narrow bus. The benefit provided by this logic is a reduction in pin-out to the memory system and increased signal integrity to the DRAM, allowing faster clock rates while maintaining capacity. While the few vendors utilizing this design have used the same general approach, their implementations vary greatly in their non-trivial details. A hardware-verified simulation suite is developed to accurately model and evaluate the behavior of this buffer-on-board memory system. A study of this design space is used to determine optimal use of the resources involved. This includes DRAM and bus organization, queue storage, and mapping schemes. Various constraints based on implementation costs are placed on simulated configurations to confirm that these optimizations apply to viable systems. Finally, full system simulations are performed to better understand how this memory system interacts with an operating system executing an application with the goal of uncovering behaviors not present in simple limit case simulations. When applying insights gleaned from these simulations, optimal performance can be achieved while still considering outside constraints (i.e., pin-out, power, and fabrication costs).","1063-6897;10636897","","10.1109/ISCA.2012.6237034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6237034","","Bandwidth;Clocks;Protocols;SDRAM;Standards;Timing","DRAM chips;buffer storage;logic circuits;memory architecture;queueing theory;system buses","CPU;DRAM;buffer-on-board memory systems;bus organization;capacity limitations;clock rates;commodity memory architecture;full system simulations;hardware-verified simulation suite;implementation costs;intermediate logic;mapping schemes;performance limitations;queue storage;signal integrity;simulated configurations","","14","","27","","","9-13 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We illustrate that shortest unique substring queries have many potential applications, such as information retrieval, bioinformatics, and event context analysis. We develop efficient algorithms for online query answering. First, we present an algorithm to answer a shortest unique substring query in O(n) time using a suffix tree index, where n is the length of string S. Second, we show that, using O(n·h) time and O(n) space, we can compute a shortest unique substring for every position in a given string, where h is variable theoretically in O(n) but on real data sets often much smaller than n and can be treated as a constant. Once the shortest unique substrings are pre-computed, shortest unique substring queries can be answered online in constant time.

Nowadays, the information systems are so complex that it becomes hard to analyze what is going on these systems and consequently hard to react in real-time and in an adequate way to the potentially- malicious events that may occur. The tool described in this article is especially designed to react in real time to various threats and challenges occurring, this mechanism is distributed and fully automated, no human intervention is required. This tool is composed of two distinct parts: the immune system and its memory. The immune system has agents that collect data on various different entities infrastructure review, analyze and deduce the Security Assurance values of these entities and commits an immune response (reconfiguration, isolation of the compromised parts, etc) upon detection of anomalies or threats. The memory securely logs the information on the events considered as potentially malicious by the immune system and the corresponding immune responses. These logs could be used by the CISO and its staff to perform digital forensics and readapt its security policies.

The depletion model proposes RBC aggregation formed from osmotic attractive forces due to polymer depletion, which overcome electrostatic repulsion due to RBC surface charge. Previous studies of simulation model under steady flow elucidated the relationship between shear rate and RBC aggregation. But shear rate could not fully explain the cyclic variation of backscattered power from blood under pulsatile flow. In the current study, a two-dimensional particle model capable of RBC mimicking the main characteristics of RBC aggregation kinetics was proposed to elucidate the relationship between microscopic RBC interactions and macroscopic rheological behavior. The mechanical model of RBCs is a depletion model under pulsatile flow. There are 596 RBCs randomly placed in a vessel (0.1X1mm) in the model driven by hydrodynamic force, aggregation force and elastic force. The mean flow velocity at the center of the tube was 2cm/s with the variation 0.5~1.5cm/s and stoke rate was changed from 40 to 80 beats per minute (bpm). The results showed mean aggregated size (MAS) was increased as velocity amplitude variation was changed from 0.5 to 1.5cm/s. The maximum MAS happened when the aggregated number decreased. Another finding was that the time to reach the maximum of RBC MAS is shorter as stroke rate was increased from 40 to 80 bpm. In addition, MAS variation was related with mean velocity, and hematocrit. The simulated results are in good agreement with previous experimental results, showing `the Bright Collapsing Ring' phenomenon and supporting the combined effects of flow acceleration and shear rate on RBC aggregation under pulsatile Poiseuille flow.","1051-0117;10510117","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724810","RBC aggregation;depletion model;pulsatile flow","Blood;Force","Poiseuille flow;aggregation;backscatter;bioacoustics;biomedical ultrasonics;blood;blood vessels;cellular transport;haemodynamics;haemorheology;hydrodynamics;medical computing;physiological models;pulsatile flow;shear flow;ultrasonic scattering","Bright Collapsing Ring phenomenon;MAS variation;RBC MAS;RBC aggregation kinetics;RBC mechanical model;RBC surface charge;aggregation force;backscattered power;beats per minute;blood vessel;bpm;computer simulation;cyclic variation;depletion model;elastic force;electrostatic repulsion;flow acceleration;hematocrit;hydrodynamic force;macroscopic rheological behavior;maximum MAS;mean aggregated size;mean flow velocity;mean velocity;microscopic RBC interaction;microscopic interactions;osmotic attractive forces;polymer depletion;pulsatile poiseuille flow;red blood cell;shear rate;simulation model;size 0.1 mm;size 1 mm;steady flow;stoke rate;tube center;two-dimensional particle model;ultrasound wave scatterers;velocity 0.5 cm/s to 1.5 cm/s;velocity 2 cm/s;velocity amplitude variation","","0","","8","","","21-25 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trade-offs among design parameters, accuracy, and resource usage are explored. A generic and parameterized architecture is developed in VHDL and validated using an FPGA implementation.

These algorithms typically involve a large number of multiply-accumulate (dot-product) operations. A recent project, DaDianNao, adopts a near data processing approach, where a specialized neural functional unit performs all the digital arithmetic operations and receives input weights from adjacent eDRAM banks. This work explores an in-situ processing approach, where memristor crossbar arrays not only store input weights, but are also used to perform dot-product operations in an analog manner. While the use of crossbar memory as an analog dot-product engine is well known, no prior work has designed or characterized a full-fledged accelerator based on crossbars. In particular, our work makes the following contributions: (i) We design a pipelined architecture, with some crossbars dedicated for each neural network layer, and eDRAM buffers that aggregate data between pipeline stages. (ii) We define new data encoding techniques that are amenable to analog computations and that can reduce the high overheads of analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). (iii) We define the many supporting digital components required in an analog CNN accelerator and carry out a design space exploration to identify the best balance of memristor storage/compute, ADCs, and eDRAM storage on a chip. On a suite of CNN and DNN workloads, the proposed ISAAC architecture yields improvements of 14.8×, 5.5×, and 7.5× in throughput, energy, and computational density (respectively), relative to the state-of-the-art DaDianNao architecture.","1063-6897;10636897","Electronic:978-1-4673-8947-1; POD:978-1-4673-8948-8","10.1109/ISCA.2016.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7551379","CNN;DNN;accelerator;analog;memristor;neural","Biological neural networks;Computer architecture;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Memristors;Neurons;Pipelines","DRAM chips;digital arithmetic;learning (artificial intelligence);memristor circuits;neural nets","ADC;DaDianNao architecture;ISAAC architecture;analog-to-digital conversion;convolutional neural network accelerator;data encoding;digital arithmetic operations;dot-product operations;eDRAM banks;in-situ analog arithmetic crossbars;in-situ processing approach;machine learning algorithms;memristor crossbar arrays;memristor storage;pipelined architecture design","","","","","","","18-22 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When tracking one target in the independent situation, other targets are masked to decrease the disturbances of skin color on the tracked one. Multiple clues, including the combination of the locally discriminative color weighted image and the back-projection image of the reference color model, the motion history image and the gradient orientation feature, are employed to verify the hypotheses originated from the particle filter. On the other hand, when the head and hands are closing or even overlapping, the multiple importance sampling (MIS) particle filter generates the tracking hypotheses of merged targets by the skin blob mask and the depth order estimation. These merged hypotheses are then evaluated by the visual cues of occluded face template, hand shape orientation and motion continuity.

Eng., Stevens Inst. of Technol., Hoboken, NJ, USA","Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR), 2013 IEEE International Conference on","","2013","","","1","7","We present the prototype of an egocentric vision based assistive co-robot system. In this co-robot system, the user is wearing a pair of glasses with a forward looking camera, and is actively engaged in the control loop of the robot in navigational tasks. The egocentric vision glasses serve for two purposes. First, it serves as a source of visual input to request the robot to find a certain object in the environment. Second, the motion patterns computed from the egocentric video associated with a specific set of head movements are exploited to guide the robot to find the object. These are especially helpful for quadriplegic individuals who do not have needed hand functionality for interaction and control with other modalities (e.g., joystick). In our co-robot system, when the robot does not fulfill the object finding task in a pre-specified time window, it would actively solicit user controls for guidance. Then the users can use the egocentric vision based gesture interface to orient the robot towards the direction of the object. After that the robot will automatically navigate towards the object until it finds it. Our experiments validated the efficacy of the closed-loop design to engage the human in the loop.","1945-7898;19457898","","10.1109/ICORR.2013.6650473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650473","active learning;co-robot;human in the loop","Cameras;Glass;Histograms;Robot kinematics;Robot vision systems","cameras;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;gesture recognition;image motion analysis;medical robotics;path planning;robot vision","closed-loop design;control loop;egocentric vision based assistive co-robot system;egocentric vision based gesture interface;forward looking camera;glasses;head movements;motion patterns;navigational tasks;quadriplegic individuals;user controls;visual input","","1","","17","","","24-26 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Decomposing, Comparing, and Synthesizing Access Control Expressiveness Simulations","W. C. Garrison; A. J. Lee","","2015 IEEE 28th Computer Security Foundations Symposium","","2015","","","18","32","Access control is fundamental to computer security, and has thus been the subject of extensive formal study. In particular, relative expressiveness analysis techniques have used formal mappings called simulations to explore whether one access control system is capable of emulating another, thereby comparing the expressive power of these systems. Unfortunately, the notions of expressiveness simulation that have been explored vary widely, which makes it difficult to compare results in the literature, and even leads to apparent contradictions between results. Furthermore, some notions of expressiveness simulation make use of non-determinism, and thus cannot be used to define mappings between access control systems that are useful in practical scenarios. In this work, we define the minimum set of properties for an implementable access control simulation, i.e., a deterministic ""recipe"" for using one system in place of another. We then define a wide range of properties spread across several dimensions that can be enforced on top of this minimum definition. These properties define a taxonomy that can be used to separate and compare existing notions of access control simulation, many of which were previously incomparable. We position existing notions of simulation within our properties lattice by formally proving each simulation's equivalence to a corresponding set of properties. Lastly, we take steps towards bridging the gap between theory and practice by exploring the systems implications of points within our properties lattice. This shows that relative expressive analysis is more than just a theoretical tool, and can also guide the choice of the most suitable access control system for a specific application or scenario.","1063-6900;10636900","","10.1109/CSF.2015.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7243722","access control;expressiveness;suitability","Analytical models;Authorization;Data models;Data structures;Lattices","authorisation;bisimulation equivalence","access control expressiveness simulation synthesis;access control system;computer security;expressiveness analysis technique;formal mapping;formal proof;simulation equivalence;taxonomy","","0","","28","","","13-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The spectral pixels are modeled by linear combinations of subspaces defined by the learned dictionary atoms, allowing for linear mixture analysis. This model provides flexibility in source representation and selection, thus accounting for spectral variability, small-magnitude errors, and noise. A spatial-spectral coherence regularizer in the optimization allows pixel classification to be influenced by similar neighbors. We extend the proposed approach for cases for which there is no knowledge of the materials in the scene, unsupervised classification, and provide experiments and comparisons with simulated and real data. We also present results when the data have been significantly undersampled and then reconstructed, still retaining high-performance classification, showing the potential role of compressive sensing and sparse modeling techniques in efficient acquisition/transmission missions for hyperspectral imagery.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2011.2163822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6026943","Hyperspectral imaging;scene classification;sparse modeling;spectral unmixing","Data models;Dictionaries;Encoding;Hyperspectral imaging;Image reconstruction;Materials","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;optimisation","acquisition mission;hyperspectral image classification;hyperspectral image mapping;learned block-structured discriminative dictionaries;linear mixture analysis;spatial-spectral coherence analysis;spectral pixel model;spectral variability analysis;subpixel model;transmission mission","","46","","66","","20110926","Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In recent years, research on pattern recognition has increased by developing various methods and algorithms for different applications. In this paper, we proposed a novel training algorithm based on the fast Beta wavelet transform for speech recognition. This approach has many advantages compared to other algorithms. The majority of the old approaches need to inverse matrix, which can be computationally intensive. However, the new algorithm is computed by the iterative application of fast wavelet transform to compute connection weights. To highlight our approach, we compared its experimental results to those of the old ones.","","","10.1109/ISDA.2015.7489241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489241","Training algorithm;acoustical environment;fast Beta wavelet network;pattern recognition;speech recognition","Artificial neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Speech;Speech recognition;Transforms","matrix algebra;speech recognition;wavelet transforms","Beta wavelet transform network;fast-learning algorithm;inverse matrix;pattern recognition task;speech recognition system","","","","14","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main strategy relies on correctly classifying the captured physiological signals, in order to distinguish whether the actual cause is a wearer health abnormality or a system functional flaw. Data fusion techniques, namely fuzzy logic, are employed to process the captured data, like the electrocardiogram and blood pressure, to increase the trust levels with which diagnostics are made. Concerning the wearer condition, additional information is provided after classifying the set of signals into normal or abnormal (e.g. arrhythmia, chest angina, and stroke). As for the monitoring system, once an abnormal situation is detected in its operation or in the sensors, a set of tests is run to check if actually the wearer shows a degradation of his health condition or if the system is reporting erroneous values.","","","10.1109/IMS3TW.2015.7177874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7177874","","Biomedical monitoring;Electrocardiography;Fuzzy logic;Heart rate;Impedance;Monitoring;Sensors","bioelectric potentials;biomedical equipment;electrocardiography;fault diagnosis;fuzzy logic;medical disorders;medical signal processing;sensor fusion","arrhythmia;blood pressure;chest angina;data capture;data fusion techniques;electrocardiogram;fault detection;fuzzy logic approach;health abnormality;health condition;highly dependable medical wearable systems;physiological signals;stroke;system functional flaw","","0","","16","","","24-26 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although there are different project types the processes, principals and successes of these types might differ. In this research we are interested in the differences and similarities between system development projects and research projects. In our investigation we used a systematic review where we used a coding schema to identify themes in the two types of projects. In comparing the two types of projects, it was found that processes and principals do compare in several themes in the number of references to the themes, but the success factors for the two types of projects are significantly different.","","Electronic:978-1-9058-2455-7; POD:978-1-5090-1955-7","10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2016.7530695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530695","Project Management Processes;Research Project Management;Systems Development Project Management","Planning;Process control;Project management;Protocols;Software;Systematics","research and development;software development management","coding schema;electronic management systems;project management;research projects;system development projects","","","","","","","11-13 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
