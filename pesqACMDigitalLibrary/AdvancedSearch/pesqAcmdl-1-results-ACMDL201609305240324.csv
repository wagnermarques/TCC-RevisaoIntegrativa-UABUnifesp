article,633323,Chad  Burkey,,,,"Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have become the standard way in which we interact with our computers and over the years and have greatly improved our computers' usability. However, as computational power becomes increasingly ubiquitous and becomes part of the environment around us, we find ourselves reaching the useful limits of the GUI. These limits are even more pronounced in new environments like the home where many of the tasks we need to perform would be difficult, inefficient, and awkward using a GUI. In an effort to develop a natural, intuitive interface for the home, we are developing a project called HomeLab, which is an agent-based, adaptive, sensing and responding home environment. This project represents a new breed of interface called an ""environmental interface."" We feel environmental interfaces are more natural because they more closely resemble the physical, social ""interface"" humans interact with in their daily lives. Fundamentally, environmental interfaces abandon the idea of a single concentrated interface such as we might associate with a computer screen, and instead treat the whole environment (a home in our example) as the interface, seamless and immediate. Not only do appliances, screens, chairs, etc. all act as input and output devices but the house itself is a distributed system of agents responding to us. Our former notions of interfaces were narrow and centralized in space because our computers were. In the age of ubiquitous computing the interface should be distributed and ubiquitous.","Limite das interfaces graficas, principalmente no lar ",GUI-he-Foco,Nao-ctx-home,Environmental Interfaces: HomeLab,47--48,,2,"environmental user interfaces, user interfaces",10.1145/633292.633323,,,,,,,2000,,CHI '00 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,CHI EA '00,,1-58113-248-4,"The Hague, The Netherlands",ACM,"New York, NY, USA"
